# Foreign aid

**Foreign aid** is the transfer of capital, goods, or services from a country or [[International organization|international organization]] to the government or population of another country.

Foreign aid advocacy as an intervention
---------------------------------------

In absolute terms, the United States is the largest donor among members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), spending around $35 billion annually on foreign aid. However, the US gives a smaller proportion of its GDP than most other DAC countries. If the US gave as large a fraction of its GDP as the United Kingdom does, its foreign aid spending would be close to $110 billion. Advocating for increased U.S. foreign aid spending is thus sometimes considered a potentially high-impact intervention.
