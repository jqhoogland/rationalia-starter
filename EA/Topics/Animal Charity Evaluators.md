# Animal Charity Evaluators

History
-------

ACE was founded in 2012, under the name of **Effective Animal Activism**, as a branch of [[80,000 Hours]]. It adopted its current name and became an independent organization in 2013.^[\[1\]](#fnure68bixj)^ 

Recommendations
---------------

Every year, ACE publishes a list of "top charities", singled out as "top giving opportunities and as ideal examples of effective advocacy." In addition, they highlight a number of "standout charities", which "conduct strong work on behalf of animals" but which for various reasons do not attain the status of a top charity. As of June 2022, ACE's top charities are [[Faunalytics]], [[The Humane League]], and [[Wild Animal Initiative]].

Funding

As of June 2022, ACE has received over $1.8 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[2\]](#fn6849t8gtxt8)^ and over $550,000 from [[Effective Altruism Funds]].^[\[3\]](#fn0k69cruhvb2k)^^[\[4\]](#fnapls6visbsr)^^[\[5\]](#fnpvuowcxw9s)^
