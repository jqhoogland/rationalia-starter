# Stanislav Petrov

**Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov** (7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a Soviet military officer.

On 26 September 1983, Petrov defied Soviet military protocol and classified reports by an early-warning system of an incoming missile strike from the United States as a false alarm. Because of this decision, which likely avoided a large-scale [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] between the Soviet Union and the United States, Petrov is often referred to as "the man who saved the world."^[\[1\]](#fnyy9c6larmz)^ His decision to report the incident as a false alarm has been described as "the most important decision of all time."^[\[2\]](#fnv4fhvn4feqs)^

Recognition
-----------

In 2018, Petrov was posthumously awarded the [Future of Life Award](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/future-of-life-institute#Future_of_Life_Award).^[\[3\]](#fnh8pzictv1jn)^

One of the rooms in the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] is named after Petrov.

September 26 is recognized as [[Petrov Day]] by many members of the [[Rationality community|rationality]] and [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] communities.
