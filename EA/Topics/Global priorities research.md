# Global priorities research

**Global priorities research** (**GPR**) is research into issues that can help decide how to allocate finite resources most cost-effectively.^[\[1\]](#fnnyvbflivwv)^ GPR can include finding and [[Cause prioritization|prioritising between different causes]] as well as [[Macrostrategy|macrostrategy]] or "foundational" research that would inform cause prioritization in a less direct way (e.g., research into the [[Fermi paradox]] or the [[Hinge of history|hinge of history hypothesis]]).

Evaluation
----------

[[80,000 Hours]] rates GPR a "highest priority area": a problem at the top of their ranking of global issues assessed by [[ITN framework|importance, tractability and neglectedness]].^[\[2\]](#fnbr35f2n6g3k)^
