# Consultancy

A **consultancy** is a professional practice that provides expert advice in a particular field or subject.

Effective altruism organizations are often constrained by the difficulty of accessing talented specialists when their needs fluctuate too rapidly to justify a new hire.

Possible examples of effective altruism consultancies include [[Rethink Priorities]], [[Berkeley Existential Risk Initiative]] and [[Good Growth]].
