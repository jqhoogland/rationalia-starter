# Indirect long-term effects

**Indirect long-term effects** are effects on the long-run future from interventions targeted at the short-term. Other terms that have been used for this concept or somewhat similar concepts include **flow-through effects**,^[\[1\]](#fnjlz1k1i5b4g)^^[\[2\]](#fntpcdo95rcrc)^^[\[3\]](#fny7dqvfoiaji)^^[\[4\]](#fngoaoypyzzpj)^ **ripple effects**,^[\[5\]](#fnw9jjlhopomn)^^[\[6\]](#fnd6t5kgfqg2h)^ **knock-on effects**^[\[7\]](#fnq16wg8b5u9)^^[\[8\]](#fn60ar42nd92y)^^[\[9\]](#fncymb7aw7r2l)^ and **cascading effects**.

When evaluating the outcome of an action, a distinction can be made between the action’s direct and indirect effects. Although the boundary between these two categories is often imprecise, direct effects are those effects that are relatively *obvious* and *intended*. Indirect effects, in turn, are effects that are either non-obvious (i.e., it is difficult to determine whether or to what extent they follow from the relevant actions), unintended, or both.

For instance, reduced [[Malaria|malaria]] incidence is a relatively direct effect of bed-net distribution, whereas more indirect effects may include improved education and increased [[Economic growth|GDP growth]] (which in turn may have even further long-run effects).

Many kinds of indirect effects have received attention within the effective altruism community, including [[Information hazard|negative side-effects of disseminating true information]], [[Naive vs. sophisticated consequentialism|negative-side effects of rule-breaking]], and [[Replaceability|replaceability effects]].
