# Brain-computer interfaces

**Brain-computer interfaces** (**BCIs**) are technologies that allow the brain to interface directly with an external computing or robotic device.

It has been argued that BCIs could make [[Totalitarianism|robust totalitarianism]] significantly more likely, and that such devices should for that reason be regarded as an [[Existential risk factor|existential risk factor]].^[\[1\]](#fnw68cbexbfm)^
