# Universe's resources

The **universe's resources** (sometimes called **humanity's** **cosmic endowment**) is the stock of physical resources in the universe currently accessible to humanity.

If humanity does not go prematurely [[Human extinction|extinct]], the number of people—or [[Moral patienthood|moral patients]] generally—who will ultimately exist is potentially astronomical. These figures are useful for judging the value of work aimed at influencing the [[Long-term future|long-term future]], and in particular for estimating the [[Importance|importance]] of avoiding [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risks]].

[[Nick Bostrom]] argues that, barring disaster, Earth will be capable of sustaining life for approximately another billion years.^[\[1\]](#fnqq49bekfnys)^ This means that if Earth’s population were to remain fairly close to what is today, then, assuming hundred-year life-spans, the planet would ultimately host about \\(10^{16}\\) people.

This is not an upper-bound on the possible number of people, however. If humans are ultimately able to [[Space colonization|colonize other star systems]], then they will not be limited by Earth’s ability to sustain life. Given certain assumptions, Bostrom estimates that humanity could eventually reach \\(10^{18}\\) to \\(10^{20}\\) stars, which could sustain a total of around \\(10^{35}\\) biological human beings, or around \\(10^{58}\\) [[Digital person|digital human minds]].^[\[2\]](#fnwtdkclefh2f)^
