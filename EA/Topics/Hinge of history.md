# Hinge of history

The **hinge of history** is a hypothetical time in human history in which humanity has disproportionate influence over the [[Long-term future|long-term future]]. The **hinge of history hypothesis** is the view that we are currently living at the hinge of history.^[\[1\]](#fnx1yj3snhlfn)^^[\[2\]](#fny99cs7uydvl)^ The hypothesis has been explicitly endorsed by a number of key figures in the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community, including [[Derek Parfit]],^[\[3\]](#fnusloiix2h4j)^^[\[4\]](#fn5duigofaygf)^^[\[5\]](#fnu4xtdlh92)^ [[Toby Ord]]^[\[6\]](#fnzh34a3evvui)^ and [[Holden Karnofsky]],^[\[7\]](#fn0h5zjvb1gjw)^ and is arguably implicit in the writings of other prominent authors, such as [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and [[Nick Bostrom]].

Whether the hinge of history hypothesis is true may determine how the present generation ought to [[Cause prioritization|prioritize between causes]] or [[Timing of philanthropy|choose between giving and investing]], and may have other important implications.

    "the part of our moral theory \[...\] that covers how we affect future generations \[...\] is the most important part of our moral theory, since the next few centuries will be the most important in human history."

    "We live during the hinge of history. Given the scientific and technological discoveries of the last two centuries, the world has never changed as fast. We shall soon have even greater powers to transform, not only our surroundings, but ourselves and our successors. If we act wisely in the next few centuries, humanity will survive its most dangerous and decisive period. Our descendants could, if necessary, go elsewhere, spreading through this galaxy."

    "I think that we are living now in the most critical part of human history. The twentieth century, I think, was the best and worst of all centuries so far. But it now seems fairly likely that there are no intelligent beings anywhere else in the observable universe. Now, if that's true, we may be living in the most critical part of the history of the universe... \[The reason\] why this may be the critical period in the history of the universe is if we are the only rational intelligent beings, it's only we who might provide the origin of what would then become a galaxy-wide civilisation, which lasted for billions of years, and in which life was much better than it is for most human beings. Well, if you look at the scale there between human history so far and what could come about, it's enormous. And what's critical is that we could blow it, we could end it."
