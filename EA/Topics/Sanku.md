# Sanku

**Sanku - Project Healthy Children** (formerly **Project Healthy Children**) is a nonprofit organization that works to prevent [[Micronutrient deficiency|micronutrient deficiencies]] by helping countries design and implement micronutrient fortification programs.

Evaluation
----------

[[GiveWell]] tentatively estimates that effective fortification programs may be in the cost-effectiveness range of their priority programs. Because of insufficient information about Sanku at the time of evaluation, GiveWell is uncertain about the cost-effectiveness of Sanku's work specifically.^[\[1\]](#fncdh93nqgwxi)^ Sanku was a GiveWell [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities) from 2016  to 2021, when that designation was discontinued

As of May 2022, Sanku has received $600,000 in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[2\]](#fnivkeyz22um)^ and is also featured in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[3\]](#fnaixq3whyvkf)^
