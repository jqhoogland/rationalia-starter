# Nuclear disarmament movement

The **nuclear disarmament movement** is a [[Social and intellectual movements|social movement]] that campaigns for reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons.

The nuclear disarmament movement may be regarded as the first social movement ever to be concerned with [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]]. Because at the time the only known major risk to humanity's long-term potential was posed by nuclear weapons, however, the concern was not framed in terms of existential risk generally, but specifically in terms of risks of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. As [Toby Ord](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/toby_ord) writes, "existential risk was a highly influential idea of the twentieth century. But because there was one dominant risk, it all happened under the banner of nuclear war."^[\[1\]](#fnm08ajnt2d4i)^
