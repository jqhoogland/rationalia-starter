    For the year 2019, GiveWell maintained their recommendation, but noted that while "SCI offers donors an outstanding opportunity to accomplish good with their donations \[...\], at this time, it does not have capacity to use new donations effectively."^[\[9\]](#fnlsebe3b6tkh)^ This notice was removed in 2020.
