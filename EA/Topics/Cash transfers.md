# Cash transfers

**Cash transfers** are direct payments, typically by governments or nonprofits, made to eligible groups of people.

Three main types of cash transfer programs have been studied: *conditional cash transfers* (CCTs), *unconditional cash transfers* (UCTs), and *business grant programs*.

[[GiveWell]] considers cash transfers to have the strongest track record of any non-health intervention, and estimates cash transfer programs to be in the same range of cost-effectiveness as their other priority programs.^[\[1\]](#fnuaqyr7no1z)^ As they acknowledge, this assessment is highly sensitive to certain empirical and moral assumptions, particularly concerning the investment returns to cash transfers and the relative value of averting child mortality *vis-à-vis* improving adult income.

Cash transfers as a benchmark
-----------------------------

An important use of cash transfers, pioneered by [[GiveDirectly]] and championed by [[GiveWell]], is as a benchmark for comparing the value of different causes and for deciding whether to fund certain charities. Cash transfers are especially attractive as a benchmark because (1) they are "massively scalable"^[\[2\]](#fntnnqtyelgd)^ and (2) their cost-effectiveness can be straightforwardly expressed as a multiplier, given plausible assumptions about the relationship between money and [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]]. Specifically, if a doubling of income confers roughly the same benefit to people regardless of income level—as life satisfaction surveys appear to suggest—, then the average citizen of a rich nation can expect to accomplish about 100 times as much by making a cash transfer to someone living in extreme poverty than by donating that money locally or keeping it to herself. This is because people in extreme poverty earn about 100 times less than people in rich countries do on average, so a donation that can double the income of one rich person can also double the income of about 100 extremely poor people.^[\[3\]](#fn2yh747rj623)^^[\[4\]](#fnxs59w07p1rp)^
