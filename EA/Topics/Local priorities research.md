# Local priorities research

**Local priorities research** (**LPR**) is research aimed at identifying high priority problems within a local context, such as the context of a particular country.

This is separate from research that aims to help a narrow group of people; the idea is to leverage local opportunities, not to narrow the moral circle.Â
