# Axiology

**Axiology**, also known as **theory of the good** and **value theory** (in a narrow sense of that term), is a branch of [[Normative ethics|normative ethics]] concerned with what kind of things and outcomes are morally good, or [[Intrinsic vs. instrumental value|intrinsically valuable]]. This is in contrast to the theory of the right, which is concerned with what people morally ought to do.

The theory of the good is typically aggregative—concerning some quantity which it is better to increase or decrease. However, in some cases people might also include principles (e.g. “an outcome is better the fewer rights violations it contains”).

There are many possible theories of value. Some hold that there is just one source of value, while others rely on multiple sources. Almost all theories agree that [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]] (also known as “welfare”) has value, and some theories, known as [[Welfarism|*welfarist*]] theories, hold that that it is the *only* thing which has intrinsic value. Non-welfarist theories recognize other [[Non-wellbeing sources of value|sources of value]], such as fairness, equality, or beauty.
