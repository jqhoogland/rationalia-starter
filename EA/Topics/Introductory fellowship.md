# Introductory fellowship

An **introductory fellowship** (sometimes called **introductory program**, **seminar program**, or **scholars program)** is a program in which a dedicated group meets several times to learn about [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]]. Typically, introductory fellowships consist of *weekly readings and discussion groups* for a period of 6–10 weeks, in groups of 3–10 people. Fellowships are a high-intensity and high-fidelity way of learning about effective altruism, and many local effective altruism groups run an intro fellowship as an early/middle part of their [funnel](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model/). 

You can learn more about intro fellowships [**here**](https://resources.eahub.org/events/fellowships/)**.**  If you're interested in running your own intro fellowship, see [**this post**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tn328tcnrKiEMb7Lr/should-you-organise-your-own-introductory-ea-program-or).
