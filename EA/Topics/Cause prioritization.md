# Cause prioritization

**Cause prioritization** refers to efforts to find the most important causes to work on and compare interventions across different cause areas, so that we can do as much good as possible with the resources available to us. This tag is for posts relevant to cause prioritization.

Governments and philanthropists spend considerable resources attempting to do good in the world. *How* those resources are used, however, can make an even bigger difference than *how many* resources are available. Some work has been done on prioritizing *within* areas, but the even more important question on how to prioritize *between* areas has received remarkably limited attention. The effective altruism community, given its emphasis on [cause neutrality](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/neutrality-in-focus-area-selection/), is especially interested in answering the latterÂ question.

Cause-neutral prioritization research seeks to identify new [promising focus areas](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/promising-areas/), and to compare their relative value (by considering, for instance, whether [animal welfare](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/animal-welfare) is a higher priority than [existential risk](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/existential-risks)). Given its very high importance and neglectedness, and moderate tractability (see [[ITN framework]]), cause prioritization research is itself often regarded as a highly promising research area.^[\[1\]](#fnrkj7kykbci)^
