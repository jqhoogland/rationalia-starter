# Suvita

**Suvita** is an organisation incubated by [[Charity Entrepreneurship]] and originally focused on running an immunization ambassadors program. In 2020 it merged with Charity Science Health, which had been working to send SMS reminders about immunisations to caregivers, in order to join forces to better increase uptake of routine vaccinations across India.
