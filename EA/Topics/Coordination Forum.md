# Coordination Forum

The **Coordination Forum** (formerly known as the Leaders Forum) is an annual event for a few dozen core members of the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community, run by the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]]. The event seeks to improve coordination among thought leaders, organization founders and major donors, by building relationships, hosting strategy discussions and collaborating on various projects.

In 2020, the Coordination Forum was replaced by the **Virtual Coordination Forum**.^[\[1\]](#fniyb7s1h71re)^
