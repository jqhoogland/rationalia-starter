# Effective Altruism Hub

The **Effective Altruism Hub** (often spelled **EA Hub**) is an independent volunteer project which hosts a global community and groups directory for the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community.

History
-------

The first version of the EA Hub was launched by [[LEAN]] in 2015. A new team assumed leadership in 2020, with fiscal sponsorship by [[Rethink Charity]]. In early 2022, the EA Hub announced that it was suspending feature developments, with plans to retire the website once a suitable replacement platform is found.^[\[1\]](#fndvi1egr5e8h)^
