# Nucleic Acid Observatory

The **Nucleic Acid Observatory** is an organization that aims to prevent [[Global catastrophic biological risk|global catastrophic biological risks]] by detecting novel agents spreading in the human population or environment. Their goal is to achieve reliable early detection of any biological threat by collecting wastewater and other environmental samples at airports and other sites, performing unbiased [[Metagenomics|metagenomic sequencing]], and analyzing the resulting data with novel pathogen-agnostic detection algorithms. It is part of the Sculpting Evolution group at the MIT Media Lab.
