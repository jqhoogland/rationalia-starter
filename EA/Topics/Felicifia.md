# Felicifia

**Felicifia** was a [[Utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] discussion forum active between late 2006 and the mid-2010s.

The forum hosted discussions, by contributors such as [[Toby Ord]], [[Carl Shulman]], and [[Brian Tomasik]], about many ideas that would later become a core part of [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]], including [[Earning to give|earning to give]], [[Wild animal welfare|wild animal welfare]], the [[Timing of philanthropy|timing of philanthropy]], and others. [[Sam Bankman-Fried]] was a regular visitor in the early 2010s, and credits that forum for introducing him to the effective altruism community.^[\[1\]](#fn7zd7aqxs03w)^

History
-------

Two versions of the Felicifia forum existed. The original version ("**Old Felicifia**") was created in late 2006 to early 2007 by Seth Baum, as a group blog/forum which superseded an earlier solo blog by Baum with the same name.^[\[2\]](#fn70bw542i74j)^ In 2008, Ryan Carey and Sasha Cooper created a new version ("**New Felificia**"),^[\[3\]](#fn03rz2caowqw7)^ and Old Felicifia was abandoned shortly thereafter.^[\[4\]](#fn0liwld7ap1s)^
