# Intervention evaluation

**Intervention evaluation** is the comparison of different interventions, normally within a given cause area. However, some organizations may compare interventions across cause areas to decide where to give. Organizations that conduct intervention evaluations include [[GiveWell]], [[Animal Charity Evaluators]], [[Charity Entrepreneurship]], [[Rethink Priorities]], [[Happier Lives Institute]], [[Future of Humanity Institute]], and the [[Center on Long-Term Risk]].
