# Postmortems & retrospectives

A **postmortem** or **retrospective** is a reflection on past actions with an eye to what went well, what didn't, and the cause of any failures. These retrospectives may include meta-commentary such as lessons learned, data gathered, and whether (and how) similar projects should be run in the future. Sharing such accounts publicly is prosocial and allows others to learn from one's experience too.
