# Workplace advocacy

**Workplace advocacy** collects posts about advocating [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] in the workplace.

This might include donation matching, fundraising within one's company, working in corporate social responsibility (CSR), or many other topics.

For now, the tag also includes posts about internal CSR projects related to EA, even if they weren't necessarily motivated by advocacy. These posts may have their own tag at some point.
