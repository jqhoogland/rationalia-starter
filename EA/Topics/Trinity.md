# Trinity

**Trinity** was the code name of the first detonation of a nuclear device. The detonation occurred on 16 July 1945 at 11:29:21 UTC. According to [[Toby Ord]], Trinity marks the beginning of "The Precipice", a period of heightened [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]] which humanity must navigate safely to realize its long-term potential.^[\[1\]](#fn3ws6d422cmg)^

Other authors have also proposed the Trinity test as marking the beginning of a new epoch.  Thus, Jan Zalasiewicz and colleagues "suggest that the Anthropocene (formal or informal) be defined to begin historically at the moment of detonation of the Trinity A-bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, at 05:29:21 Mountain War Time (± 2 s) July 16, 1945 (= 11:29:21 Co-ordinated Universal Time = Greenwich Mean Time)."
