# Charity incubation

**Charity incubation** is the provision of various types of support for the creation of a new charity. This support can involve things like training, advice, seed funding, connections, and operational support. It could also involve actively trying to work out what new types of new charities should be founded (e.g., which interventions it would be worth having a new charity working on) and then finding people to found those charities.

Organizations that focus primarily on charity incubation are known as **charity incubators**. Examples of charity incubators aligned with [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] are [[Charity Entrepreneurship]] and the [[Longtermist Entrepreneurship Fellowship]]. There are also organizations that, despite not being charity incubators, engage in some charity incubation activities. Examples include [[GiveWell]] (via its incubation grants).^[\[1\]](#fnbzigrvt6v1b)^
