# Climate engineering

**Climate engineering**, sometimes also referred to as **geoengineering** or **climate intervention**, is intentional, large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system.^[\[1\]](#fnm0tz465ttek)^ One reason to engage in climate engineering would be to counter anthropogenic [[Climate change|climate change]]. The main techniques that could be used for climate engineering are carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management.
