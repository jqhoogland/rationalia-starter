# Funding high-impact for-profits

Funding for-profits that address a pressing social need can be a promising way to have a positive social impact.

An example of a social enterprise that is regarded as effective within the effective altruism community is [[Living Goods]]. It supports a network of community health promoters that sell health products door-to-door and provide basic health counseling in sub-Saharan Africa. [[GiveWell]] lists it under the “Other Charities Worthy of Special Recognition” category, but recommends donating to Living Goods rather than investing in them.^[\[1\]](#fn828p8rzn96f)^
