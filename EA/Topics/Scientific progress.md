# Scientific progress

The **scientific progress** tag is for posts about:

*   The potential risks and benefits of progress in different areas
*   Strategies for changing the rate of progress in different areas
*   General information related to progress (e.g. factors that tend to encourage it)
*   Specific examples of progress (e.g. a major advance in an important scientific field)

For posts about more specific aspects of the scientific ecosystem and how that can be improved, use the [[Metascience|meta-science]] tag.
