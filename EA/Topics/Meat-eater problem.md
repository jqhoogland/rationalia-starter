# Meat-eater problem

The **meat-eater problem** (sometimes called the **poor meat-eater problem**) is the concern that some interventions aimed at helping humans might increase animal product consumption and as a result increase [[Farmed animal welfare|farmed animal suffering]], e.g. by increasing real income or human population.

History
-------

The meat-eater problem appears to have been first explicitly described in a [[Felicifia]] post from 2009.^[\[1\]](#fni12x95af82p)^

Further details
---------------

Saving human lives, and making humans more prosperous, seem to be obviously good in terms of direct effects. However, humans consume animal products, and these animal products may cause considerable [[Farmed animal welfare|animal suffering]]. Therefore, improving human lives may lead to negative effects that outweigh the direct positive effects. This “meat-eater problem” suggests that working on [[Global poverty|global poverty]] may be less effective than is commonly assumed.

Although it is very difficult to quantify these effects, one estimate suggests that each additional $1,000 per year for a relatively poor individual may cause between 1 and 190 days of animal suffering, though the estimate should not be taken literally.^[\[2\]](#fneskgkd37yfi)^ Some have argued that the problem is less significant by [[Logic of the larder|claiming that animals have net positive lives]], or by arguing that the effect on consumption is relatively small.^[\[3\]](#fnm0ozcpbbf1)^
