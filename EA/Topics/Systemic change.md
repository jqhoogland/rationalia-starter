# Systemic change

**Systemic change** is change relating to practices or institutions established as normative or customary throughout a political, social, or economic system.

Some [[Criticism of effective altruism|critics of effective altruism]] allege that its proponents have failed to engage with systemic change.^[\[1\]](#fnqyujpe49oz)^ Whether they are right or not depends on what is meant by the term. Members of the community are working on political issues within areas such as [[Macroeconomic policy|macroeconomic policy]], [[Immigration reform|immigration reform]] and [[Land use reform|land use reform]].^[\[2\]](#fndip5razdtl)^ However, work on certain types of "radical" change, such as attempts to overthrow capitalism or abolish private property, are much less common.^[\[3\]](#fn4e1lz55z5yw)^
