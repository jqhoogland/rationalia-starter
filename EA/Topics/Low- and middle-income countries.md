# Low- and middle-income countries

**Low- and middle-income countries** (**LMICs**) are all countries not considered to be high-income. Although there is no universally agreed-upon definition, the World Bank defines high-income countries as those with a gross national income per capita of $12,696 or more in 2020. Countries with a gross national income per capita below that line include upper-middle, lower-middle, and low-income countries, all of which are classified as LMICs.
