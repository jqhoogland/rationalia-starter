# Instrumental convergence thesis

The **instrumental convergence thesis** is the alleged overlap in instrumental goals expected to be exhibited by a broad class of advanced [[Artificial intelligence|AI systems]], due to their usefulness for the attainment of a wide range of possible final goals.

Commonly expected instrumental goals towards which all intelligent agents would converge are self-preservation, goal preservation, and resource acquisition.

From [[Superintelligence (book)]]
> Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense
that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent’s goal being realized
for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a broad spectrum of situated intel-
ligent agents.
