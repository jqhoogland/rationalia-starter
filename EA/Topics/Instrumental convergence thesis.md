# Instrumental convergence thesis

The **instrumental convergence thesis** is the alleged overlap in instrumental goals expected to be exhibited by a broad class of advanced [[Artificial intelligence|AI systems]], due to their usefulness for the attainment of a wide range of possible final goals.

Commonly expected instrumental goals towards which all intelligent agents would converge are self-preservation, goal preservation, and resource acquisition.
