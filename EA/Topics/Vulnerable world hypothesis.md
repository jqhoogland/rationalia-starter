# Vulnerable world hypothesis

The **vulnerable world hypothesis** (**VWH**) is the view that there exists some level of technology at which civilization almost certainly gets destroyed unless extraordinary preventive measures are undertaken. VWH was introduced by [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2019.^[\[1\]](#fn5oro9ooa0ld)^

Historical precedents
---------------------

Versions of VWH have been suggested prior to Bostrom's statement of it, though not defined precisely or analyzed rigorously. An early expression is arguably found in a 1945 address by [[Bertrand Russell]] to the House of Lords concerning the detonation of atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and its implications for the future of humanity.^[\[2\]](#fnp5ilpu46ag)^ (Russell frames his concerns specifically about [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear warfare]], but as [[Toby Ord]] has argued,^[\[3\]](#fn5tcetgh7xts)^ this is how early discussions about existential risk were presented, because at the time nuclear power was the only known technology with the potential to cause an [[Existential catastrophe|existential catastrophe]].)

> All that must take place if our scientific civilization goes on, if it does not bring itself to destruction; all that is bound to happen. We do not want to look at this thing simply from the point of view of the next few years; we want to look at it from the point of view of the future of mankind. The question is a simple one: Is it possible for a scientific society to continue to exist, or must such a society inevitably bring itself to destruction? It is a simple question but a very vital one. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the gravity of the possibilities of evil that lie in the utilization of atomic energy. As I go about the streets and see St. Paul's, the British Museum, the Houses of Parliament and the other monuments of our civilization, in my mind's eye I see a nightmare vision of those buildings as heaps of rubble with corpses all round them. That is a thing we have got to face, not only in our own country and cities, but throughout the civilized world as a real probability unless the world will agree to find a way of abolishing war. It is not enough to make war rare; great and serious war has got to be abolished, because otherwise these things will happen.
