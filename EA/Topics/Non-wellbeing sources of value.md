# Non-wellbeing sources of value

Nearly all moral theories assign some value to [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]]. But while some theories hold that well-being is the only source of value (“welfarist theories”), other theories recognize other sources of value.

How value is defined tends to depend on the preferred moral theory. [[Deontology|Deontologists]] tend to focus on principles which should guide actions, such as “treat others as you would want to be treated”, while [[Virtue ethics|virtue ethicists]] concentrate on specific virtues like wisdom or benevolence. Non-welfarist [[Consequentialism|consequentialists]] are more likely to focus on non-welfare goods like knowledge, beauty, and diversity.

Theories which recognize multiple sources of value also need some mechanism for dealing with cases where the different values conflict.
