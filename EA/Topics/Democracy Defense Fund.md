# Democracy Defense Fund

The **Democracy Defense Fund** (**DDF**) was a project formed in March 2017 to match up donors interested in [[Safeguarding liberal democracy|safeguarding liberal democracy]] in the United States with subject matter experts familiar with effective giving opportunities.

DDF had two funds: a Democratic Participation Fund and a Free Press Fund. It awarded grants to three organizations: Repairers of the Breach, Forward Justice, and Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

DDF's team consisted of Barbara Fried, a Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, and Connor Flexman.
