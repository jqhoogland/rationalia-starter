# Survival and Flourishing

Â **Survival and Flourishing Fund** (**SFF**) and **Survival and Flourishing Projects** (**SFP**) are two related entities that facilitate grants to projects [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|aiming to improve the long-term future]].

SFF and SAP share a common mission and leadership, and work closely with each other, but are not formally related and have different functions. SFF generally makes grants to existing charities, while SAP makes smaller grants to individuals.
