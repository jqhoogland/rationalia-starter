Abolition of suffering
----------------------

Pearce argues that it is technically feasible and ethically rational to abolish suffering on the planet by replacing Darwinian suffering-based motivational systems with minds motivated exclusively by pleasant experience. He stresses that this "abolitionist project" is compatible with a diverse set of values and "intentional objects".^[\[2\]](#fn9qq7dvjqrqu)^
