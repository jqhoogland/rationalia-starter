# Poverty trap

A **poverty trap** is a set of hypothesized self-reinforcement mechanisms that cause poor countries to remain poor, such that present poverty directly causes future poverty. A commonly postulated mechanism is that, when resources can at most only meet the basic needs of the population, the lack of resources available for investment will constrain economic development, perpetuating poverty.^[\[1\]](#fni35zb85t8b)^
