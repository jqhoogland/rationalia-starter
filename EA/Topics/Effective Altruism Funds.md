# Effective Altruism Funds

**Effective Altruism Funds** (often called **EA Funds**) are expert-managed, cause-specific pools of funds for regranting. This structure allows small and large donors to efficiently delegate their charitable decision-making to central fund managers. Since the EA Funds sometimes support small, speculative, or individual projects that would not normally qualify for tax deductions, this can also be tax-efficient, as donations to EA Funds are deductible in some jurisdictions.

EA Funds is a spin-off of the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]]. Currently, four Funds exist:

1.  [[Global Health and Development Fund|Global Health and Development]]
2.  [[Animal Welfare Fund|Animal Welfare]]
3.  [[Long-Term Future Fund|Long-Term Future]]
4.  [[Effective Altruism Infrastructure Fund|Effective Altruism Infrastructure]]
