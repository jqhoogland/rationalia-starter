# Dual-use

Technology, research or artifacts are **dual-use** if they have both upside and downside potential. Sometimes the term is used more narrowly to describe technology, research or artifacts that can be used for both civilian and military purposes.^[\[1\]](#fnta73fx6zobk)^

Examples
--------

Dual-use research is particularly relevant in the field of [[Biosecurity|biosecurity]]. A salient example is so-called "gain-of-function" research, which "might help identify the most dangerous strains of flu in nature, create targets for vaccine development, and alert the world to the possibility that H5N1 could become airborne"^[\[2\]](#fnzpbww67jlsn)^ but could also cause the accidental deployment of a biological agent and provide malicious actors with information that enables them to create particularly dangerous pathogens.

Concerns about dual-use come up in other contexts, too, including other [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risks]] besides [[Global catastrophic biological risk|global catastrophic biological risks]]. One example relates to risks from [[Asteroids|asteroids]]: technology that helps move asteroids away from Earth can be used to move asteroids *towards* Earth, either accidentally or intentionally.^[\[3\]](#fnn382f5mu8j)^
