# Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge

The **Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge** (**SDUK**) was an educational society established in 1826 that published a series of inexpensive books on scientific and technical subjects.

The goal of the SDUK, which has been characterized as "a Benthamite-oriented group",^[\[1\]](#fnhvtd4sq9kjo)^ was to "improv\[e\] workers' efficiency and ad\[d\] to the nation's pool of inventors and engineers."^[\[2\]](#fncjix1c7ajvk)^ In a letter to [[John Stuart Mill]], Thomas Carlyle—famous for his criticisms of [[Democracy|democracy]], [[Economics|economics]], and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarianism]]—derided the Society's "triumphant quackle-quackling intent only on sine and cosine."^[\[3\]](#fnv1inmjp0xsf)^
