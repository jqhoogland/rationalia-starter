# Comprehensive AI Services

**Comprehensive AI services** (**CAIS**) is an approach to understanding [[Superintelligence|superintelligence]] proposed by [[Eric Drexler]]. In Drexler's words, "CAIS provides a model of flexible, general intelligence in which agents are a class of service-providing products, rather than a natural or necessary engine of progress in themselves."^[\[1\]](#fn53a475906n)^ On this approach, advanced AI systems are conceived as "services", or systems with an expanding set of capabilities, one of which is the optional capability of agency.
