# Working at EA vs. non-EA orgs

The **working at EA vs. non-EA orgs** tag is for posts that include arguments for or against pursuing jobs at organisations that explicitly identify with the "effective altruism" label, relative to jobs at other organisations. The tag is also for posts that include discussion of whether and why members of the EA community may be biased in one direction or the other on this question, and how to address that (e.g., how to raise the status - within the EA community - of high-impact work at non-EA orgs).

This tag is not intended for posts that discuss things like how the effectiveness of EA orgs tends to differ from that of non-EA orgs, except when those posts connect this to the question of where EAs should work.
