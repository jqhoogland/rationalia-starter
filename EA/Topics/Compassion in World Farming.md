# Compassion in World Farming

**Compassion in World Farming** (**CIWF**) is an organization that campaigns to end [[Farmed animal welfare|factory farming]].

Activities
----------

CIWF activities include engaging in political campaigning to encode animal welfare protections into law; working with companies to improve welfare standards for farmed animals; and engaging in outreach efforts to reduce consumption of animal products.

Evaluation
----------

Most evaluations of CIWF have focused on **Compassion in World Farming USA** (**CIWF USA**, or **Compassion USA**), the US branch of CIWF.

[[Animal Charity Evaluators]] considers CIFW USA "an excellent giving opportunity because of their strong programs focused on improving the welfare of animals in the U.S."^[\[1\]](#fngo4u2y1lpif)^ CIFW USA is also recommended by [[Founders Pledge]] as "one of the most cost-effective animal advocacy organisations in the world."^[\[2\]](#fnrnth44xsep)^

As of August 2022, [[Open Philanthropy]] has granted over $14.7 million to CIFW^[\[3\]](#fngpq2szytlbf)^ and over $3.2 million to CIFW USA.^[\[4\]](#fnrjnt2tvjffq)^ Both organizations have also received comparatively small donations from [[Effective Altruism Funds]].^[\[5\]](#fni3p7ygivtpr)^^[\[6\]](#fn91yennwqub)^^[\[7\]](#fn9igshmo0ner)^
