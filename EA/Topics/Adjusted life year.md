# Adjusted life year

An **adjusted life year** is a measure of the value of a year of life adjusted in ways relevant for moral or medical valuation.

The most commonly used types of adjusted life year are **quality-adjusted life years** (**QALYs**) and **disability-adjusted life years** (**DALYs**). Both QALYs and DALYs fall under the broader category of **health-adjusted life years** (**HALYs**), which rely on measures of health to make the relevant adjustments. HALYs are commonly used in public health to quantify the [[Burden of disease|burden of disease]] and to compare the [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effectiveness]] of different health interventions. By contrast, **wellbeing-adjusted life years** (**WALYs**) adjust based on measures of [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]], such as hedonic experience or preference satisfaction. One type of WALY is the WELLBY, which measures wellbeing on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, representing the answers "not at all" and "completely", respectively, to the question "Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?"^[\[1\]](#fn2lapu1y0bll)^ Within the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community, WALYs are generally preferred over HALYs, because things other than health can contribute to a person's wellbeing, and because health itself, while often a good proxy for wellbeing, is not generally regarded as intrinsically valuable.^[\[2\]](#fnrr0ltkcv9p)^
