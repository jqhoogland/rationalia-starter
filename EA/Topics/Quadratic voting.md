# Quadratic voting

**Quadratic voting** is a collective decision-making procedure in which each participant is given an equal budget of voting credits, which they can use to vote for or against a proposal (such as a candidate or issue). Participants can cast as many votes for a given proposal as their budget allows, but the costs increase quadratically, i.e. it costs  \\(n^2\\) credits to cast \\(n\\) votes for the proposal.
