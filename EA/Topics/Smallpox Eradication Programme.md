# Smallpox Eradication Programme

The **Smallpox Eradication Programme** was a program by the [[World Health Organization]] to eradicate smallpox worldwide. The program was created at the instigation of [[Viktor Zhdanov]], a Soviet virologist, and ran between 1966 and 1980, when the eradication of smallpox was officially certified.
