# Impact assessment

**Impact assessment** is a structured process for evaluating the impact of an intervention. Impact assessments can focus on an intervention's expected impact (*ex-ante* or prospective impact assessment) or on its actual impact (*ex-post* or retrospective impact assessment).^[\[1\]](#fneo10yzz4ct)^

Impact assessment is sometimes contrasted with ***impact evaluation***, which is understood to be broader in scope and includes impacts not considered in standard impact assessments.^[\[1\]](#fneo10yzz4ct)^
