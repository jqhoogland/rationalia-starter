# Hedonium

**Hedonium** is the arrangement of the universe's resources optimized for the production of pleasurable experience.^[\[1\]](#fnek4v25cjjmv)^

The term was introduced by [[Carl Shulman]] in a 2012 essay.^[\[2\]](#fn4b6sxq66aqt)^ Shulman also defined **dolorium** as the arrangement of the universe's resources optimized for the production of pain. Sometimes the term **utilitronium** is used to express this same concept, though that expression may instead be understood more broadly as referring to whichever state is regarded as the ultimate bearer of value, such as preference satisfaction on preference utilitarianism.
