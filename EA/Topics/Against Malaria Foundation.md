# Against Malaria Foundation

The **Against Malaria Foundation** (**AMF**) is a British charity that provides funding for [[Mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets|mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets]] (LLINs) to populations at high risk of [[Malaria|malaria]].

History
-------

In June 2003, Rob Mather, a strategy consultant based in London, decided to organize a swim with two of his friends to raise funds for a girl who had suffered severe burns in a house fire. Over the following months, Mather's initiative grew in size and scope, eventually leading to the creation of **World Swim Against Malaria** (**WSAM**), which organized a quarter of a million swims in around 160 countries. In August 2004, Mather set up AMF to handle the money raised through WSAM and to raise funds in ways other than swimming.^[\[1\]](#fn60lobxtgsub)^^[\[2\]](#fnx7gmt8nhswg)^

AMF continues to operate mostly as it did when it first launched. Although registered as a charity in 12 countries, AMF has no offices, but is run from the back room of Mather's house.^[\[3\]](#fnfqlpqxquyf9)^

Activities
----------

In addition to funding distribution of nets, AMF has more recently supported research on piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets, a new type of LLIN.^[\[4\]](#fnlaao49dmw19)^ Mosquito populations appear to have become more resistant to standard insecticides. According to GiveWell's rough estimates, this resistance has reduced the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets by one-third in the areas where AMF operates.^[\[5\]](#fnmajgbxqz0f)^ Against resistant mosquitoes, PBO nets appear to be more effective than standard insecticide-treated nets. An AMF-funded trial—the largest such trial to assess the effectiveness of PBO nets to date—found that PBO nets reduced malaria 26%, 27% and 16% more than did conventional LLINs after 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively.^[\[6\]](#fnoftm90522ba)^

Evaluation
----------

As of July 2022, [[GiveWell]] estimates that AMF can deliver a LLIN at a cost of about $5, and that a donation to AMF has an average [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of $5,500 per life saved.^[\[7\]](#fnv9lxhfgn64)^^[\[8\]](#fnssbmdabxil)^^[\[9\]](#fn09mgl17tmdrm)^  (The cost of delivering a net is much lower than the cost of saving a life because a small fraction of people who receive a net would otherwise have died of malaria, and because of other factors.)^[\[8\]](#fnssbmdabxil)^

AMF has been a [[GiveWell]] top-rated charity every year since 2010, with the exception of 2013, when it was excluded from their ranking due to lack of [[Room for more funding|room for more funding]] .^[\[10\]](#fngblt5r8eydc)^ AMF is also included in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[11\]](#fneqm0g2cmsfi)^

As of June 2022, AMF has received over $58 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[12\]](#fn7njyyywpsug)^ and over $6.5 million from [[Effective Altruism Funds]].^[\[13\]](#fn7klr5h00q1)^^[\[14\]](#fnfynsdjy92o)^^[\[15\]](#fncpsjdb9pfbj)^ 

AMF is a highly [[Transparency|transparent]] organization. The AMF website lists every donation received^[\[16\]](#fngerw26t1tm5)^ and every LLIN distributed,^[\[17\]](#fnbz4bvqwpj7u)^ as well as other pertinent information.^[\[18\]](#fndc8mnnby9)^
