# Person-affecting views

In [[Population ethics|population ethics]], **person-affecting views** are views that attempt to capture the [[Intuition of neutrality|intuition]] that an outcome can be bad only if it is bad for people. (By 'people' it is meant a [[Moral patienthood|moral patient]] rather than a human being.) [[Derek Parfit]] distinguishes between **narrow person-affecting views**, which hold that an outcome can be bad only if it is bad for the people who exist in this outcome, and **wide person-affecting views**, which allow that an outcome can be bad if some different attainable outcome would have benefited people in it more.
