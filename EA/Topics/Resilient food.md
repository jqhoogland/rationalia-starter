# Resilient food

**Resilient food** (sometimes called **alternative food, ** **alternate food** or **emergency food**) and **resilient food solutions** are those foods, food production methods or interventions that would allow for significant food availability in the face of a global catastrophic food shock (GCFS). These solutions should be well-suited for contributing to an adequate food supply for the greatest number of people even in the worst scenarios, for example by being scalable and amenable to rapid production ramp-up.^[\[1\]](#fn24sheiuq7po)^ 

Such food could be produced even if a [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophe]] such as a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[Supervolcano|supervolcano]] eruption, or [[Asteroids|asteroid]] impact significantly reduces the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by releasing large quantities of sulfate aerosols, smoke or ash into the atmosphere.^[\[1\]](#fn24sheiuq7po)^  Examples of resilient foods for these abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (ASRS) include seaweed and single-cell protein grown from natural gas.^[\[2\]](#fnfexj9bhaz6)^ Other examples of ASRS-resilient food solutions could be: relocation of cool tolerant crops to more adequate climates, rapid deployment of greenhouses,^[\[3\]](#fntpy5yy72c2)^ and systems or policies for a rapid emergency phaseout of systems with a net consumption of food such as first-generation biofuels or most animal agriculture.^[\[1\]](#fn24sheiuq7po)^ 

Research and development of resilient foods for GCFS scenarios can reduce [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic risk]], increase global [[Food security|food security]], and reduce the risk of [[Civilizational collapse|civilizational collapse]] from [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. One organisation that focuses mostly on resilient foods is the nonprofit [[ALLFED]].
