# Economics of artificial intelligence

The **economics of artificial intelligence** studies the implications for [[Economic growth|economic growth]] and labor markets of increasingly powerful AI systems. The economics of AI also covers the study of short-term and long-term economic dynamics that affect the development of AI, including increased production of computing resources; the relationship between access to human capital and speed of AI research; and competition dynamics among AI firms. The field draws heavily from the study of technical change and innovation in economics, and their effect on economic growth and firm dynamics.
