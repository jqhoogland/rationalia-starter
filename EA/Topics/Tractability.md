# Tractability

The **tractability** of a problem (also called its **solvability**) is the degree to which it is solvable by a given increase in the resources allocated to it. Together with [[Importance|importance]] and [[Neglectedness|neglectedness]], importance is one of the three factors in the [[ITN framework]].
