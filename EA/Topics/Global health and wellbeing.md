Some consider these designations to be inaccurate or misleading, because they overemphasize [[Temporal discounting|temporal discounting]] and overlook its other defining characteristics, such as tight feedback loops, non-[[Fanaticism|fanaticism]], and tangible impact.^[\[1\]](#fn2mai76sf85l)^^[\[2\]](#fnx3td3il12u)^^[\[3\]](#fn4ljbtpmoqad)^
