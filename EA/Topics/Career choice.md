# Career choice

**Career choice** studies the ethical and practical considerations bearing on the choice of a high-impact career.

People spend more time on their jobs than on any other activity besides sleep—about 80,000 hours over the course of a typical life.^[\[1\]](#fnea7wscznj)^ Choosing the right career may thus be one of the most impactful things an altruistically-motivated person can do.

Despite its high [[Importance|importance]], impact-oriented career choice has received limited attention. One of the earliest publications on the subject was a youth essay by Karl Marx, who held that we should choose the career "which offers us the widest scope to work for mankind". Such a career, Marx claimed, would be best not only altruistically but also for the person pursuing it, since "experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy."^[\[2\]](#fnfusg63p1s2i)^ In contemporary philosophy, there is a small literature on whether it is permissible to pursue a non-altruistic rather than an altruistic career, but almost no discussion of how different careers should be ethically ranked.^[\[3\]](#fnm59lgx4gu9)^ 

The organization [[80,000 Hours]] specializes in research about and support for impact-oriented career choice, and has developed a [[Career framework|framework]] for comparing the social impact of different careers.

[[Holden Karnofsky]] has identified four alternative frameworks for making career choice decisions: *paths* to particular roles working on particular causes; *aptitudes* a candidate can build in a variety of roles and causes and apply to a variety of jobs; *causes* to which a candidate can contribute with their career; and *heuristics*, such as "Do work you can be great at" or "Do work that builds your career capital and gives you more options."^[\[4\]](#fnjxkoi9def8)^ 80,000 Hours uses the "paths" framework, while Karnofsky has focused mostly on the aptitude framework, though he advises candidates to consider multiple frameworks.
