# Books

The **books** tag covers posts about books.

If you're looking for summaries and reviews, you might also find LessWrong's "[Book reviews](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/book-reviews)" tag relevant. On the Forum, the "[[Collections and resources|collections and resources]]" tag might also be related. 

Some EA books have their own tag: [[The Precipice|*The Precipice*]] | [[Doing Good Better|*Doing Good Better* ]] | [[Poor Economics|*Poor Economics*]] | [[Superintelligence (book)|*Superintelligence*]] | [[The Life You Can Save (book)|*The Life You Can Save*]] | [[Human Compatible|*Human Compatible*]]  |  [[What We Owe the Future|*What We Owe the Future*]]
