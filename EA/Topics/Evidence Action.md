# Evidence Action

**Evidence Action** is a nonprofit that implements several evidence-based and cost-effective programs to combat [[Global poverty|global poverty]].

Evaluation
----------

Evidence Action's [[Deworm the World Initiative]] program was a [[GiveWell]] top charity between 2013 and 2022. Their [[Dispensers for Safe Water]] program was a GiveWell [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities) from 2017 to 2021, when that designation was discontinued. 

In the past, GiveWell also recommended Evidence Action's No Lean Season program, which provided no-interest loans to poor rural households between planting and the major rice harvest in rural northern Bangladesh.^[\[1\]](#fnlpasiuxxbnb)^ This recommendation was later discontinued following a disappointing 2017 study and the termination of Evidence Action's partnership with the organization implementing the program.^[\[2\]](#fn2c8ec652gfl)^

As of July 2022, [[Open Philanthropy]] has granted over $96 million to Evidence Action.^[\[3\]](#fnqowuh176jm)^

[[The Life You Can Save]] features Evidence Action in their list of "best charities".^[\[4\]](#fnb44izq1l2t4)^
