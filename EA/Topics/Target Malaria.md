# Target Malaria

**Target Malaria** is a nonprofit research consortium working to develop [[Gene drives|gene drive]] technologies to control the mosquitoes that transmit [[Malaria|malaria]] in sub-Saharan Africa. It is led by Austin Burt, a professor of evolutionary genetics at Imperial College London.

Activities
----------

In July 2019, after obtaining approval from the National Biosafety Agency and the ethics committee of the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Santé of Burkina Faso, Target Malaria released a strain of genetically modified (but non gene drive) sterile male mosquito in Bana, a town in the Balé province of that West African country.^[\[3\]](#fn6m4h8dvr89x)^ Target Malaria has also research teams in Cape Verde, Ghana, Mali, and Uganda.

Evaluation
----------

Target Malaria is primarily funded by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] and [[Open Philanthropy]], which in May 2017 recommended a $17.5 million grant over four years.^[\[2\]](#fnbkgvppzdhgd)^^[\[4\]](#fn4xxg8tqoduk)^ Open Philanthropy estimates that their grant to Target Malaria is competitive with donations to the [[Against Malaria Foundation]].^[\[5\]](#fndzgoi5e8h1r)^
