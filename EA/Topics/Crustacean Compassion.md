# Crustacean Compassion

**Crustacean Compassion** is a nonprofit organization that campaigns for the humane treatment of crabs, lobsters and other decapod [[Crustacean welfare|crustaceans]] in the United Kingdom.

Activities
----------

Crustacean Compassion's activities so far have focused on organizing a public petition to include crustaceans as a class of animals protected by the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill;^[\[1\]](#fnqe79esjn7m)^  releasing a report outlining the ethical, legal and scientific arguments for the protection of crustaceans;^[\[2\]](#fntzgs3ke75a)^ and drafting an open letter to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, signed by over fifty animal welfare scientists and other relevant experts, asserting the sentience of crustaceans and calling for their protection.^[\[3\]](#fnob4mxg71sys)^

In November 2021, following the publication of a report by the London School of Economics on decapod and cephalopod sentience,^[\[4\]](#fn39agdk739xp)^ the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill was amended to recognize crabs, octopuses and lobsters as sentient beings.^[\[5\]](#fna4fy0ihwjtv)^^[\[6\]](#fnkjw0ve6rqq)^^[\[7\]](#fnnny86v2hm9)^
