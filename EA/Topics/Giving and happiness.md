# Giving and happiness

**Giving and happiness** refers to the apparent causal relationship that exists between prosocial spending and subjective wellbeing.

When a person donates money that they could have spent on themselves, the resulting change in wellbeing depends not only on the welfare loss from forgone self-interested spending, but also on possible welfare gains associated with the perception that the spending will help other people or promote a worthy cause. The net causal impact of giving on happiness can thus be analyzed as the sum of these two effects.

Within the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community, the relationship between giving and happiness has attracted some attention because it bears on a number of debates of interest, such as debates concerning [[Altruistic motivation|altruistic motivation]] and the [[Altruistic motivation|demandingness of morality]].
