# Career framework


The **career framework** is a model developed by [[80,000 Hours]] to evaluate careers in terms of their social impact. The standard version of the model comprises four primary factors: [[Career capital|career capital]], [[Role impact|role impact]], [[Supportive conditions|supportive conditions]], and [[Personal fit|personal fit]]. The first three factors are additive, which interact multiplicatively with the fourth factor.

More recently, the model has been extended to capture the value of [[Altruistic coordination|coordination]]. This extension incorporates two additional factors: *relative fit*, or the person's comparative advantage relative to members of the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community, and *community capital*, or the extent to which the person's actions increase the community's future impact and ability to coordinate.
