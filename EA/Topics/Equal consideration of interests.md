# Equal consideration of interests

**Equal consideration of interests** is the view according to which the interests of every [[Moral patienthood|moral patient]] matter equally. An early proponent of equal consideration of interests was [[Jeremy Bentham]], who popularized the *dictum*, "everybody to count for one, nobody for more than one".^[\[1\]](#fnrmrfi914yvj)^

The equal consideration of interests view can be contrasted with views that accord greater weight to the interests of some moral patients over others. Examples include *partialism*, which gives extra weight to the agent's own interests and those of their family members or fellow nationals, and [[Prioritarianism|*prioritarianism*]], which gives extra weight to the interests of the worse off.
