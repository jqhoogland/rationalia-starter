# Cosmopolitanism

**Cosmopolitanism** is the view that gives the interests of people of other nationalities a weight equal to those of one’s compatriots.

Because people in [[Global poverty|poorer countries]] are more likely than people in richer countries to face severe problems that could be solved at [[Cost-effectiveness|little cost]], it is often a good general heuristic to focus one’s attention on impoverished parts of the world, rather than looking for giving opportunities in one’s local area (assuming one is from a richer country).
