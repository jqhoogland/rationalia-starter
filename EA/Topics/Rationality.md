# Rationality

Use the **Rationality** tag for posts about trying to think more clearly in general (not just about a particular cause, intervention, etc.)

This tag can cover personal rationality (e.g. making better decisions or predictions) as well as group or movement-level rationality (e.g. how the EA movement can do a better job of estimating the cost-effectiveness of an intervention).
