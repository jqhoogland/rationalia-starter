# Time of perils

The **time of perils** is a hypothetical period in human history during which [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]] is unusually high. The **time of perils hypothesis** is the view that we are currently living in a time of perils.

Duration of the time of perils
------------------------------

Carl Shulman has argued that the time of perils will likely last only a few centuries because of various technological developments that are jointly expected to eventually bring down existential risk per century to very low levels. As Shulman writes,^[\[1\]](#fn7z9emt9nimt)^

> It's quite likely the extinction/existential catastrophe rate approaches zero within a few centuries if civilization survives, because:

> 1.  Riches and technology make us comprehensively immune to  natural disasters.
> 2.  Cheap ubiquitous detection, barriers, and sterilization make civilization [immune to biothreats](https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2020/05/what-would-civilization-immune-to.html)
> 3.  Advanced tech makes neutral parties immune to the effects of nuclear winter.
> 4.  Local cheap production makes for small supply chains that can regrow from disruption as industry becomes more like information goods.
> 5.  Space colonization creates robustness against local disruption.
> 6.  Aligned AI blocks threats from misaligned AI (and many other things).
> 7.  Advanced technology enables stable policies (e.g. the same AI police systems enforce treaties banning WMD war for billions of years), and the world is likely to wind up in some stable situation (bouncing around until it does).
