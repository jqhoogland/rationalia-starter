# Effective giving

**Effective giving** is the branch of [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] focused on charitable donations.

The main purpose of effective giving is to support a charity that can achieve an especially large amount of good with that support. However, effective giving on a sufficient scale can also influence the charitable sector, giving charities an incentive to improve their own effectiveness.

Issues related to effective giving
----------------------------------

There are a variety of issues related to effective giving.

Some of these issues relate to how to ensure that the donation has the largest direct impact possible. For instance, donors often tend to give to multiple organizations, but there are reasons to think that it may be more effective not to [[Philanthropic diversification|diversify donations]] in this way. Relatedly, donors have choices about [[Timing of philanthropy|when to give their money]]. For instance, they could decide to save money, and give it away later, rather than giving now. There continues to be debate about which of these options is more effective in general. Third, one person’s donations may impact the effectiveness of another person’s donations, raising the tricky question of [[Philanthropic coordination|how they should coordinate to collectively maximize their impact]].

Other issues focus more on the indirect impact of donations, in particular the impact on others who are considering whether and where to donate. One way to increase your positive impact on others’ donations is to [[Public giving|give publicly]].

Finally, one way of improving the effectiveness of donations is to try to identify the features shared by past cost-effective donations. For this reason, studying the [[History of philanthropy|history of philanthropy]] may be a source of lessons that could improve how donors fund projects.
