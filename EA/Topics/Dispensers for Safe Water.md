# Dispensers for Safe Water

**Dispensers for Safe Water** is a program run by [[Evidence Action]] that provides chlorine dispensers for decontamination of drinking water to reduce diarrhea and prevent associated deaths in young children.

Evaluation
----------

A review by [[GiveWell]] found strong evidence for the effects of chlorination in reducing most diarrhea-causing microorganisms, but weaker evidence for a causal link between water chlorination programs and reductions in diarrhea and death among young children.^[\[1\]](#fnpxakivosrk)^  GiveWell estimates that the Dispensers for Safe Water program is in the same cost-effectiveness range as unconditional [[Cash transfers|cash transfer]] programs.^[\[1\]](#fnpxakivosrk)^ Dispensers for Safe Water was a GiveWell [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities) from 2017 to 2021, when that designation was discontinued.

In 2022, GiveWell made a major update in their assessment of water quality interventions. The update was prompted by preliminary results from a meta-analysis of mortality data from [[Randomized controlled trials|randomized controlled trials]] of water quality interventions conducted by [[Michael Kremer]]'s team. Based on these results, GiveWell now estimates the mortality reduction in young children attributable to those interventions to be 14%, an increase of 11 percentage points from their previous estimate. In line with this update, GiveWell now considers Dispensers for Safe Water to be four to eight times as cost-effective as unconditional cash transfers. The re-evaluation also prompted GiveWell to recommend a grant of up to $64.7 million for the organization in January 2022. GiveWell also speculates that Dispensers for Safe Water or similar programs could use $350 million per year globally at equal cost-effectiveness.^[\[2\]](#fnwxntrxrkp6f)^
