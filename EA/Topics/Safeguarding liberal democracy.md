# Safeguarding liberal democracy

**Safeguarding liberal democracy** refers to attempts to improve, promote or protect liberal forms of [[Democracy|democratic]] government, characterized by universal suffrage, competitive elections, a market economy, separation of powers, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.

Evaluation
----------

According to [[80,000 Hours]], liberal democracies seem to foster [[Economic growth|economic growth]], [[Peace and conflict studies|promote peace]] and spearhead innovation to a greater degree than do other forms of government tried so far.^[\[1\]](#fn4nrwiy5zcl)^ Many alternatives to liberal democracy, on both ends of the political spectrum, have historically been associated with great human suffering: [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes, in particular, are estimated to have been responsible for the deaths of over 125 million people in the 20th century alone, mostly in the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and communist China.^[\[2\]](#fnn2luk9j65v)^ Furthermore, a report from [[Rethink Priorities]] argues that many of the attributes of liberal democracy are conducive to intermediate [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|longtermist]] goals, such as reduced [[Great power conflict|great power conflict]], [[Moral circle expansion|moral circle expansion]], and the [[Building effective altruism|flourishing of effective altruism]].^[\[3\]](#fnaugo12rygyw)^ For these and other reasons, safeguarding liberal democracy is considered a promising cause by some members of the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community; as of June 2022, 80,000 Hours rates it a "potential highest priority"—an issue that, if more thoroughly examined, could rank as a top global challenge.^[\[4\]](#fnrf98t0d7jw)^
