# Singleton

A **singleton** is a world order in which there is a single decision-making agency at the highest level. The **singleton hypothesis** is the hypothesis that Earth-originating intelligent life will eventually assume the form a singleton.

The concept of a singleton expresses an abstract idea. A singleton could take the form of [[Global governance|world government]], such as global [[Democracy|democracy]] or global [[Totalitarianism|totalitarianism]], but this need not be so. What is required for humanity to constitute a singleton is for it to behave roughly like a coherent agent.^[\[1\]](#fn57v5nrv70yb)^^[\[2\]](#fnpukudumsrha)^
