# Student projects

**Student projects** collects projects that can be undertaken by students with little to no prior knowledge or experience. Student projects can range from focusing on direct impact, to focusing more on internal development, knowledge transfer and career planning. Examples of projects are: fundraising, organizing retreats, skilling up in AI, preparing lightning talks about EA related topics, and going through the 8-week career planning program by 80,000 Hours.Â
