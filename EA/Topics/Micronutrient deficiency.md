# Micronutrient deficiency

Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals needed in small amounts for normal growth and development. **Micronutrient deficiencies** affect over two billion humans worldwide,^[\[1\]](#fna8qof71x8cb)^ and have been shown to affect people’s physical health (e.g. iron deficiency causes anemia) and cognitive function (e.g. iodine deficiency negatively affects mental development and lowers IQ). Many [[Farmed animal welfare|farm animals]] appear to also be deficient in some micronutrients, because their diets are optimized for food production rather than overall health.^[\[2\]](#fnm4ua3le6dnn)^

There are three ways to reduce micronutrient deficiencies: giving people micronutrient supplements directly (supplementation); enriching staple foods such as rice, flour, oil and salt with micronutrients (fortification); and breeding or genetically manipulating plants to increase their micronutrient content (biofortification).

Treating micronutrient deficiencies in humans is a very [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]] intervention: it usually costs only a few cents per person per year to provide particular vitamins or minerals.^[\[3\]](#fncwp4tnvmf2)^ One of [[GiveWell|Givewell]]’s top-rated charities—[[Helen Keller International]]'s vitamin A supplementation program—focuses on reducing micronutrient deficiencies.^[\[4\]](#fnxo66373u35)^ In animals, the organization [[Healthier Hens]] focuses on feed fortification for egg-laying hens.
