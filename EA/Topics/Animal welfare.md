# Animal welfare

**Animal welfare** is a core focus area within [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]]. It focuses on ways to improve the [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]] of nonhuman animals, primarily [[Farmed animal welfare|in factory farms]] and [[Wild animal welfare|in the wild]].

Animals currently make up the vast majority of sentient beings. As many as 2.8 trillion animals might be killed for food each year, and there are many more wild animals.^[\[1\]](#fnh53dfy2msjh)^  Although many experts agree that animals display some signs of sentience, it remains an open question [[Animal sentience|which animals are sentient]], and how we should compare welfare between species.

Despite its [[Importance|importance]], this focus area is highly [[Neglectedness|neglected]]: animal charities receive only 3% of charitable donations, and 99% of that money is focused on pets, who make up less than 0.1% of all domesticated animals.^[\[1\]](#fnh53dfy2msjh)^

The area also appears to be somewhat [[Tractability|tractable]]. [[Open Philanthropy]] estimates that past [[Corporate animal welfare campaigns|corporate cage-free campaigns]] have spared about 120 years of suffering in battery cages per dollar donated.^[\[2\]](#fn9p99275w97f)^

Some people focus more narrowly on [[Farmed animal welfare|farmed animal welfare]] or on [[Wild animal welfare|wild animal welfare]].

Some have argued that, if one takes the view that future beings matter morally, interventions that seek to reduce short-term animal suffering may not be as cost-effective as interventions that seek to influence [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|the far future]]. In response, others have argued that animal welfare will also have strong beneficial effects on the far future.^[\[1\]](#fnh53dfy2msjh)^ An objection to that argument is that it would be remarkable if an intervention selected for its short-term effects just happened to have better long-run consequences than all other interventions.^[\[3\]](#fnvsgdg1eotb)^ In addition, critics have noted that there are theoretical reasons for expecting human interventions to have better long-run effects than animal interventions.^[\[4\]](#fn0vj5j5qvz53)^ The considerations bearing on this issue are numerous, complex, and hard to assess, and the debate is currently unresolved.^[\[5\]](#fn6xgz1agm288)^
