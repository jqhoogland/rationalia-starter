# Malaria Consortium

**Malaria Consortium** is a British charity that works on preventing, controlling, and treating [[Malaria|malaria]] and other communicable diseases in Africa and Asia.

Its seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program—one among many programs carried out by this organization—distributes preventive anti-malarial drugs to children under five to reduce incidence during the high transmission season.

Evaluation
----------

Malaria Consortium's SMC program has been a [[GiveWell]] top-rated charity since 2016,^[\[1\]](#fny7e25nces5n)^ and its cost-effectiveness is estimated to be in the same range as GiveWell's other priority programs.^[\[2\]](#fn7dhqrkn1nsd)^ GiveWell estimates that SMC can protect a child from malaria at a cost of about $7, and that a donation to this program has an average [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of $5,000 per life saved.^[\[3\]](#fnb2c1napnmna)^^[\[4\]](#fnp192e4ph93l)^^[\[5\]](#fnubvkqjo0il)^ (The cost of protecting a child from malaria is much lower than the cost of saving a life because a small fraction of people who receive protection would otherwise have died of malaria, and because of other factors.)^[\[4\]](#fnp192e4ph93l)^

Malaria Consortium is also featured in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[6\]](#fndz44bhlhlgg)^

As of August 2022, Malaria Consortium has received over $188 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[7\]](#fnn8d81uhcjlm)^ and over $3.1 million from [[Effective Altruism Funds]].^[\[8\]](#fnj7miegu5f2)^^[\[9\]](#fnd1gu52wobim)^
