# Differential progress

**Differential progress** is the hastening of risk-reducing progress and the delaying of risk-increasing progress.

Differential progress can be regarded as a generalization of the proposal, first made by [[Nick Bostrom]], to accelerate risk-reducing technological progress and retard risk-increasing technological progress.^[\[1\]](#fnvsg8gsgzvcn)^ This proposal, which Bostrom calls **differential technological development**, was originally offered as an alternative to the view that technological progress as a whole should be slowed down in response to concerns about [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]]. As Bostrom argued, since technology has the potential to both increase and decrease risk, the appropriate response is to handle technologies with different effects on risk differently, rather than having a general policy of technological retardation. In more recent publications, Bostrom understands "technology" in a very broad sense, to include "not only gadgets but also methods, techniques and institution design principles"^[\[2\]](#fnidqq2ho285n)^ and "scientific ideas, institutional designs, organizational techniques, ideologies, concepts, and memes".^[\[3\]](#fnj1kpoww6c7)^ When the notion of differential technological development is combined with this expansive understanding of technology, it becomes roughly equivalent to differential progress, rather than a special case of it.

The term "**differential intellectual progress"** is sometimes used as a synonym for "differential progress", though it may also be used more restrictively to exclude non-intellectual forms of progress.^[\[4\]](#fnqagcqeun7ue)^^[\[5\]](#fnfyz5u4inxp7)^
