# Eric Drexler

**Kim Eric Drexler** (born 25 April 1955) is an American author and engineer, currently Senior Research Fellow at the [[Future of Humanity Institute]].

Drexler is most famous for his pioneering work on [[Atomically precise manufacturing|atomically precise manufacturing]], especially as presented in his books *Engines of Creation*,^[\[1\]](#fn7xwyc6us0qy)^ a popular introduction to the core ideas, and *Nanosystems*,^[\[2\]](#fntfzktinjvyl)^ a comprehensive graduate-level survey of the field (itself based on his MIT doctoral thesis^[\[3\]](#fnls58ka5o0xl)^^[\[4\]](#fnophkxnz01is)^). More recently, Drexler's research has focused on [[AI risk]], where he has developed an approach he calls [[Comprehensive AI Services]].^[\[5\]](#fnq6zpcqk66x)^ Drexler has also made original contributions to the [[Fermi paradox]],^[\[6\]](#fnezrstzwdd9)^ [[Space colonization|space colonization]],^[\[7\]](#fned54p4rc2m)^ distributed computing,^[\[8\]](#fn8dc0oy8jq63)^ hypertext publishing,^[\[9\]](#fng550odilbe)^ and other fields.^[\[10\]](#fn1nsug7t9rs6)^^[\[11\]](#fnracaew6jr29)^
