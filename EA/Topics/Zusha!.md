# Zusha!

**Zusha!** (the Swahili expression for "protest!") is a road safety campaign launched in Kenya in 2015 by Georgetown University's Initiative on Innovation, Development, and Evaluation in partnership with local authorities. The program aims to reduce road accidents through stickers placed inside of public service vehicles with messages encouraging passengers to complain directly to reckless drivers.
