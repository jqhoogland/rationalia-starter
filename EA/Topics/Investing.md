# Investing

The **Investing** tag covers posts about how we can invest our money to produce higher impact, whether we want to increase our expected returns, create stable funding for long-term endeavors, or pursue other goals related to doing more good.

This differs from the [[Socially responsible investing]] tag, which concerns investments which are directly aimed at generating positive impact.

(Please be very careful when reading free investment advice distributed on an open online forum.)
