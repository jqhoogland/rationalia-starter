# New Incentives

**New Incentives** is a charity that works in North West Nigeria to increase the uptake of routine immunizations through conditional [[Cash transfers|cash transfers]].

Evaluation
----------

New Incentives has been a [[GiveWell]] top-rated charity since 2020.^[\[1\]](#fnvmy64tkhmar)^ GiveWell estimates that New Incentives can vaccinate an infant at a cost of about $160, and that a donation to New Incentives has an average [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of $5,000 per life saved.^[\[2\]](#fnqomn7qzh0oc)^^[\[3\]](#fnq9uhfg4vhkr)^^[\[4\]](#fnktj2avlzo5)^ (The cost of incentivizing a caregiver to complete a baby's immunization schedule is much lower than the cost of saving a life because a small fraction of children who receive immunization would otherwise have died from the diseases that immunization confers protection against, and because of other factors.)^[\[3\]](#fnq9uhfg4vhkr)^

As of July 2022, New Incentives has received nearly $42 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[5\]](#fnh7uymy1s4vp)^ and is also featured in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[6\]](#fnt2u7yg80p1c)^
