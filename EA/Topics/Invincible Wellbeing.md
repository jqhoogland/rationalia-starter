# Invincible Wellbeing

**Invincible Wellbeing** (IW) is a non-profit organization focused on foundational research and applied work targeting the biological substrates of [[Pain and suffering|suffering]]. IW also hosts a podcast under the same name, where Jacob Shwartz-Lucas (IW’s Executive Director) interviews scientists on topics relevant to IW’s prioritization and research.

IW also manages the Joshua Cefalu Fund, a fund that “seeks to advance understanding of the biological basis for suffering, model its global distribution, and most effectively minimize it”.^[\[1\]](#fnc22sqk6jrkk)^ The fund offers grants to research projects that further the fund's goal. The fund was created in partnership with the Joshua Cefalu Foundation and Henry George School of San Francisco.^[\[1\]](#fnc22sqk6jrkk)^

IW’s Director of [[Bioethics]] is philosopher [[David Pearce]].^[\[2\]](#fn3xhohvoygtl)^
