# Norman Borlaug

**Norman Ernest Borlaug** (25 March 1914 - 12 September 2009) was an American agricultural scientist who won the Nobel Prize for his work breeding high-yield varieties of wheat. The introduction of these new crops into developing countries, with the associated increase in agricultural productivity and reduction in deaths from starvation, arguably make Borlaug responsible for saving an extraordinary number of human lives.^[\[1\]](#fn6ucmdrlncnb)^
