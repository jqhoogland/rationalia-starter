# Career advising

For posts that offer career advising, discuss better (and worse) types of career advising, etc.

Types of career advice research
-------------------------------

One proposed typology of research on career advice distinguishes between career *choice* research ("Which career paths are especially impactful?"), career *success* research ("What strategies are best for succeeding in a career?"), and career *intervention* research ("What can be done to help people pursue impactful careers?"). Within career success research, a further distinction may be drawn between *generic* (or movement-level) and *specific* (or individual-level) research, depending on whether the research aims to identify the most impactful careers in general or whether it seeks to determine whether a career is a good fit for a particular person or group of people.^[\[1\]](#fnv3netmmua8c)^^[\[2\]](#fnwn9drmvw7ml)^

Organizations within the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] community providing career advice include [[80,000 Hours]], [[Animal Advocacy Careers]] and [[Probably Good]].
