# Community epistemic health

The **community epistemic health** tag applies to posts addressing the current state of epistemic health in the effective altruism community, as well as posts discussing how we might improve the epistemic health of the community.

Effective altruism is about working out how to do as much good as we can using evidence and reason and then taking action on that basis. Â Posts here are particularly concerned with how well the movement is able to use evidence and reason, norms that affect discourse between individuals and how individuals form beliefs.  
  
If you have ideas for improving or retaining epistemic norms within the EA community please email Nicole Ross (community health team manager at CEA) at nicole\[dot\]ross\[at\]centreforeffectivealtruism.org .
