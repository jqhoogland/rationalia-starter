# Ideological Turing test

The **ideological Turing test** (sometimes called the **political Turing test**^[\[1\]](#fniuhpitd1cxl)^) is a test of a person's ability to state opposing views as clearly and persuasively as those views are stated by their proponents. The test was originally proposed by [[Bryan Caplan]],^[\[2\]](#fnf86iwfksflu)^ in analogy with Alan Turing's "imitation game"—more widely known as the Turing test—, which measures a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from that of a human.
