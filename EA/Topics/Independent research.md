# Independent research

**Independent research** is research conducted by an individual who is not employed by any organisation or institution, or who is employed but is conducting this research separately from that. This person may or may not have funding for this research (e.g., via grants). Research that is done by two or more people collaborating, but still separate from an organisation or institution, could arguably be considered independent research.

There are various advantages and disadvantages of independent research relative to research conducted as part of an organisation or institution.

This tag is intended for posts relevant to things like tips for doing independent research or advantages and disadvantages of independent research, not just for posts that are examples of independent research.
