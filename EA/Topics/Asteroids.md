# Asteroids

**Asteroids** are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Depending on their size, asteroids with the potential to collide with planet Earth could pose a [[Global catastrophic risk|global catastrophic risk]] or even an [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]].

Recommendations
---------------

In [[The Precipice|*The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*]], [[Toby Ord]] offers several [[Policy|policy]] and [[Research|research]] recommendations for handling risks from asteroids and comets:^[\[1\]](#fnxjqcoyeuy58)^

*   Research the deflection of 1 km+ asteroids and comets, perhaps restricted to methods that couldn’t be weaponized such as those that don’t lead to accurate changes in trajectory.
*   Bring short-period comets into the same risk framework as near-Earth asteroids.
*   Improve our understanding of the risks from long-period comets.
*   Improve our modeling of impact winter scenarios, especially for 1–10 km asteroids. Work with experts in climate modeling and nuclear winter modeling to see what modern models say.
