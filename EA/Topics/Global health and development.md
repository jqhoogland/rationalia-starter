# Global health and development

Different initiatives to improve public health, reduce poverty, or increase economic growth - especially in the developing world - are all part of an ongoing project to promote global health and development.

In 2013, roughly 767 million people lived on less than the equivalent of $1.90 per day, adjusted for purchasing power.^[\[1\]](#fnphn1q4i5kdb)^ Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many aspects of people’s lives, including access to education and healthcare. Poverty and poor health also seriously hinder the [[Wellbeing|wellbeing]] of millions of people. This is why [[Global poverty|economic poverty]] and [[Burden of disease|the global burden of disease]] are important focus areas for [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]].

As a result of widening global inequality, the cost of averting death is much lower in low-income countries. For instance, [[GiveWell]] estimates the cost per child life saved through a bed-net distribution funded by the [[Against Malaria Foundation]] at about $3,500.^[\[2\]](#fnl2img5hgr8l)^ By contrast, the British National Health Service considers it cost-effective to spend £25,000-£37,000 for *a year* of healthy life saved.^[\[3\]](#fnn4estvu7tcq)^ This means that donations to charities that work on global poverty and global health can be very cost-effective. Global inequality also affects the impact of cash transfers: given the extent of global inequality, a dollar is worth 66 times as much to a person living in extreme poverty as to the average American.^[\[4\]](#fn5i69gk4s2k)^

Some worry that employing aid to tackle these issues is problematic. Effective altruism has sought to address several of these concerns, including worries about [[Foreign aid skepticism|aid effectiveness]] and [[Aid and paternalism|aid and paternalism]].  
  
See [[Organizations and projects in effective altruism|here]] for a list of organizations working on global health and development.
