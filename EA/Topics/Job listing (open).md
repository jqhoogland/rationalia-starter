# Job listing (open)

Use **job listing (open)** for posts that discuss a specific job or jobs that one or more organizations are hiring for.

You can also find job listings on the "[Who's hiring?](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DXcg6N6CGvRA2vrCk/who-s-hiring-may-september-2022)" post.

After a request has been completed, or if it's no longer relevant, downvote this tag and add [[Job listing (closed)|job listing (closed)]]. This can be done by anyone, not just the original poster.

There are also job boards:Â 

*   [A list of job boards](https://tomweinresearch.me/job-boards/)
*   [Animal Advocacy Careers job board](https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/job-board)
*   [The 80,000 Hours job board](https://80000hours.org/job-board/)
*   [EA internships board](https://ea-internships.pory.app/board)

You can also find more ways to get involved on the [[Take action|take action]] page.
