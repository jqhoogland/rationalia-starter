# Disentanglement research

**Disentanglement research** refers to "a type of research that involves disentangling ideas and questions in a “pre-paradigmatic” area where the core concepts, questions, and methodologies are under-defined." When coining the term, [[Carrick Flynn]] gave [[Nick Bostrom]] as an example of someone skilled at this type of research.^[\[1\]](#fnvhwg2gixn2o)^
