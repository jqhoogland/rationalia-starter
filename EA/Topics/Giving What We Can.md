# Giving What We Can

**Giving What We Can** (**GWWC**) is an organisation dedicated to inspiring and supporting people to give more, and give more effectively. It is a project of the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]].

Giving What We Can promotes three [[Donation pledge|donation pledges]], the most prominent of which is a commitment to donate at least 10% of one's income each year in the way one thinks will achieve the most good. As of June 2022, this pledge has been signed by more than 7,500 people.

Giving What We Can also aims to support its members, to help them connect with and support each other, and to [[Building effective altruism|build effective altruism]], [[Effective giving|effective giving]], and various related cause areas.

History
-------

Giving What We Can was conceived of by [[Toby Ord]] (who was inspired by the ideas of ethicists such as [[Peter Singer]]) to commit to donating a large proportion of his income to effective charities.

In November 2009, Ord and [[William MacAskill|Will MacAskill]] launched Giving What We Can as an international community of people who were committed to giving more, and giving more effectively. The Centre for Effective Altruism was incorporated in 2011 as registered charity and an umbrella organisation for Giving What We Can and the then newly founded [[80,000 Hours]].

Giving What We Can was one of the first in a growing network of like-minded organisations focused on [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]], the project of using evidence and reason to figure out how to best contribute to helping others, and taking action on that basis.
