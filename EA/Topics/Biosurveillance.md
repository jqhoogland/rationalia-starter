# Biosurveillance

**Biosurveillance**, in the context of [[Biosecurity|biosecurity]], is the detection and monitoring of biological agents to prevent biological threats. This is most commonly associated and achieved via [[Metagenomics|metagenomic sequencing]], the readout of the totality of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) present in an environmental sample.

Examples
--------

A prominent biosurveillance implementation is BioWatch, a US federal program designed to detect the release of known pathogens in 21 American cities. It mainly focuses on detecting airborne releases and subsequent PCR-based testing against a list of candidate pathogens. BioWatch has, however, been criticised for failing to respond to known threats while sounding false-positive alarms.

An unbiased, metagenomic sequencing-based proposal is the [[Nucleic Acid Observatory]]. It aims to detect any changes in the presence and composition of nucleic acids in major waterways and sewage, thus recognising emerging pathogens as early as possible.
