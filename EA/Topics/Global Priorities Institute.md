# Global Priorities Institute

The **Global Priorities Institute** (**GPI**) is an interdisciplinary research centre at the University of Oxford whose aim is to conduct foundational research that informs the decision-making of individuals and institutions seeking to do as much good as possible. It is directed by [[Hilary Greaves]].

GPI was established in January 2018 with a seed grant of £2 million from [[Open Philanthropy]] and a commitment of another £2 million from two private philanthropists.^[\[1\]](#fn7f6ofoih4y)^ Currently, GPI's research focuses on two main areas: [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|longtermism]] and general issues in [[Cause prioritization|cause prioritization]].
