# Patient altruism

**Patient altruism** (sometimes called **patient longtermism**) is the view that individuals can have a greater positive impact by investing current altruistic resources and spending them later than by spending them now. These resources include both financial and non-financial resources. The narrower view that altruists should invest and later donate *financial* resources, instead of donating them now, is sometimes called **patient philanthropy**, although these expressions are sometimes used interchangeably.
