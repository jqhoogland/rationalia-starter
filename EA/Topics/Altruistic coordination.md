# Altruistic coordination

**Altruistic coordination** is the study of how individual altruists should act when the impact of each person's decisions depends on the actions of other altruists. Such coordination could take many forms, including [[Philanthropic coordination|philanthropic coordination]]; [[Moral trade|moral trade]]; attempting to consider comparative advantage and [[Replaceability|replaceability]] rather than just [[Personal fit|personal fit]]; building "community capital"; and taking a "portfolio approach".^[\[1\]](#fnqf7m4wt8ppq)^

This coordination could be achieved via actual discussion between the relevant altruists. Alternatively, an altruist could simply try to roughly predict  how their actions will affect the actions of other altruists, or follow rules of thumb intended to aid in altruistic coordination.

Altruists often fail to attempt altruistic coordination, instead taking actions based on what *would* be the best action *if* other people aiming to do good weren’t responding to what they do. Todd refers to this as "single-player thinking".^[\[1\]](#fnqf7m4wt8ppq)^ Additionally, even when a person does attempt altruistic coordination, it can be difficult to work precisely how to do so, and the communication and trust involved in good coordination can be costly to maintain. As more people try to work together to do good, it appears that achieving low-cost coordination will be a difficult but important problem to solve (see also [[Value of movement growth|value of movement growth]]).
