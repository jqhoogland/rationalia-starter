# Public relations

**Public relations** (**PR**) is "the practice of managing and disseminating information from an individual or an organization \[. . .\] to the public in order to affect their public perception. Public relations and publicity differ in that PR is controlled internally, whereas publicity is not controlled and contributed by external parties".^[\[1\]](#fnh8yy4ylu8p)^
