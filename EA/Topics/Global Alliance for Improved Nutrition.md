# Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition

The **Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition** (**GAIN**) is a foundation based in Switzerland focused on reducing world malnutrition.

Evaluation
----------

GAIN implements a wide range of programs, only one of which—its universal salt iodization (USI) program—has been evaluated by [[GiveWell]]. In GiveWell's assessment, the cost-effectiveness range of salt iodization is very close to that of their priority programs,^[\[1\]](#fn03e4o3kcezu)^ though they are less certain about the cost-effectiveness of GAIN's USI program.^[\[2\]](#fny7avpfwl12r)^

 USI was a GiveWell [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities) from 2014 to 2021, when that designation was discontinued. USI is also one of the three organizations focused on [[Education|education]] recommended by [[Founders Pledge]]^[\[3\]](#fnxrx8e5bwuee)^ and is featured by [[The Life You Can Save]] in their list of "best charities".^[\[4\]](#fn72exhrvvsfn)^

As of July 2022, GAIN has received $1.1 million in grants from [[Open Philanthropy]].^[\[5\]](#fnkavzmmyfsc)^
