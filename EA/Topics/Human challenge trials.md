# Human challenge trials

**Human challenge trials** (also called **human challenge studies** and **human infection studies**) are clinical trials that involve deliberately exposing willing volunteers to an infectious disease. Human challenge trials have been used for several diseases, including influenza, typhoid fever, cholera, [[Malaria|malaria]] and, more recently, [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]].
