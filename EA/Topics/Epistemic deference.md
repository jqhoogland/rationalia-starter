# Epistemic deference

**Epistemic deference** is the process of updating one's beliefs in response to what others appear to believe, even if one ignores the reasons for those beliefs or do not find those reasons persuasive. The question of when, how, and to what extent a rational agent should defer to others has been studied—from somewhat different angles—by philosophers working in social epistemology and by economists working in game theory.
