# The Humane League

**The Humane League** (**THL**) is a nonprofit organization that works to improve animal welfare standards through [[Corporate animal welfare campaigns|corporate outreach]], media outreach, and grassroots campaigns.

History
-------

THL was founded in 2005 as a small grassroots organization to protest foie gras at local restaurants in Philadelphia. It has since refocused on ending all forms of abuse in animals raised for food. It currently operates in four countries in three different continents and is part of Open Wing Alliance, a global coalition of organizations working to eliminate battery cages around the world.^[\[1\]](#fnxwjolmk5ol)^
