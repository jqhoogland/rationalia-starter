# 80,000 Hours

**80,000 Hours** is a nonprofit organization that helps individuals select [[Career choice|high-impact careers]]. It conducts research on pressing social problems and provides one-on-one advice on the basis of this research.

History
-------

80,000 Hours was founded in July 2011 by Ben Todd and [[William MacAskill]]. The organization was called **High Impact Careers** for a year or so before adopting its current name.^[\[1\]](#fn5u551jydpx9)^^[\[2\]](#fn5i5g5nqlq0g)^ In its early years, 80,000 Hours placed great emphasis on [[Earning to give|earning to give]]; since around 2015, the organization has de-emphasized this career path in favor of direct work, especially work in research, advocacy, and policy.^[\[3\]](#fn8az4rstzww2)^

Approach
--------

At the core of 80,000 Hours' rankings and recommendations are two main "frameworks": a [[Problem framework|problem framework]], which ranks problems in terms of [[Importance|importance]], [[Tractability|tractability]] and [[Neglectedness|neglectedness]], and a [[Career framework|career framework]], which recommends careers based primarily on [[Career capital|career capital]], [[Role impact|role impact]], and [[Supportive conditions|supportive conditions]], with [[Personal fit|personal fit]] as a common fourth factor in both frameworks.

Funding
-------

As of July 2022, 80,000 Hours has received over $9.8 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[4\]](#fnawqiwiim2ft)^ over 1.1 million from [[Effective Altruism Funds]],^[\[5\]](#fn7vlfy6cj96v)^^[\[6\]](#fn7e0vyumckwe)^^[\[7\]](#fnpz4iltcv1ij)^^[\[8\]](#fn7x4uwbj3wo)^^[\[9\]](#fnue7uy27i1gn)^^[\[10\]](#fn4sndugscned)^^[\[11\]](#fnoaj93vpllqj)^^[\[12\]](#fn2wr3k8ef3hu)^ and nearly $300,000 from the [[Survival and Flourishing]] Fund.^[\[13\]](#fnmgnltltvy48)^^[\[14\]](#fn1eoa6wwdb7e)^
