**Peter Albert David Singer** (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian philosopher, currently a professor of philosophy at Princeton University. Singer is generally regarded as one the most influential living philosophers, and has been a key figure behind both the [[Effective animal advocacy|animal welfare]] and the [[Effective altruism|effective altruism]] movements.

Singer is the recipient of the 2021 Berggruen Prize, sometimes described as "the Nobel Prize for philosophy". The committee praised Singer for reinvigorating [[Utilitarianism|utilitarianism]] both within academia and as a force in the world.^[\[1\]](#fnrwl1zxaaqtn)^ Singer announced that he would donate half of the $1 million prize to [[The Life You Can Save]], with the remainder split in a roughly 2:1 ratio between organizations recommended by [[Animal Charity Evaluators]] chosen by Singer and organizations recommended by The Life You Can Save chosen by the public on a vote to be held in late 2021.^[\[2\]](#fnjrmg11u18l)^
