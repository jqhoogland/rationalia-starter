# Macrostrategy

**Macrostrategy** is the study of how present-day actions may influence the [[Long-term future|long-term future]] of humanity.^[\[1\]](#fn82uo5yn5q5b)^

Macrostrategy as a field of research was pioneered by [[Nick Bostrom]], and it is a core focus area of the [[Future of Humanity Institute]].^[\[2\]](#fny31bfvlj09i)^ Some authors distinguish between "foundational" and "applied" [[Global priorities research|global priorities research]].^[\[3\]](#fngkke5k63u)^ On this distinction, macrostrategy may be regarded as closely related to the former. It is concerned with the assessment of general hypotheses such as the [[Hinge of history|hinge of history hypothesis]], the [[Vulnerable world hypothesis|vulnerable world hypothesis]] and the [[Technological completion conjecture|technological completion conjecture]]; the development of conceptual tools such as the concepts of [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]], of a [[Crucial consideration|crucial consideration]] and of [[Differential progress|differential progress]]; and the analysis of the impacts and capabilities of future technologies such as [artificial general intelligence](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/human-level-artificial-intelligence), [[Whole brain emulation|whole brain emulation]] and [[Atomically precise manufacturing|atomically precise manufacturing]], but considered at a higher level of abstraction than is generally the case in [[Cause prioritization|cause prioritization research]].
