# Supervolcano

A **supervolcano** is an unusually large volcano with the potential to produce an eruption with major effects on the global climate system.

Recommendations
---------------

In [[The Precipice|*The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*]], [[Toby Ord]] offers several [[Policy|policy]] and [[Research|research]] recommendations for handling risks from supervolcanic eruptions:^[\[1\]](#fnxjqcoyeuy58)^

*   Find all the places where supervolcanic eruptions have occurred in the past.
*   Improve the very rough estimates on how frequent these eruptions are, especially for the largest eruptions.
*   Improve our modeling of volcanic winter scenarios to see what sizes of eruption could pose a plausible threat to humanity.
*   Liaise with leading figures in the asteroid community to learn lessons from them in their modeling and management.
