# Personal fit

**Personal fit** is a measure of a person's chances of excelling in a particular job.

Formally, personal fit it may be defined as the ratio of the person's [[Productivity|productivity]] in the job to the average productivity of other candidates likely to take that job. Personal fit is one of the factors in [[80,000 Hours]]' original [[Career framework|career framework]], as well as a key element in their current list of strategic considerations.^[\[1\]](#fnicamz6rovqe)^

Personal fit measures a person's absolute advantage in a job. But a person's comparative becomes relevant when [[Altruistic coordination|coordination]] is feasible. In such cases, a career with lower personal fit may have a greater community impact.^[\[2\]](#fn388skbuku1l)^
