# Self-care

Use the **self-care** tag for posts about caring for one's own emotional, mental, or physical health.Â 

Effective altruism can be intense, difficult, and even overwhelming; fortunately, the Forum contains a lot of good posts on how we can stay healthy and maintain balance as we try to do as much good as we can.
