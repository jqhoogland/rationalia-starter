# Non-humans and the long-term future

The **non-humans and the long-term future** tag is for posts relevant to questions such as:

*   To what extent (if at all) is [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|longtermism]] focused only on humans?
*   To what extent should longtermists focus on improving wellbeing (or other outcomes) for humans? For other animals? For [[Artificial sentience|artificial sentiences]]? For something else?
*   Are [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risks]] just about humans?
*   Will most [[Moral patienthood|moral patients]] in the long-term future be humans? Other animals? Something else? By how large a margin?
