# Lead Exposure Elimination Project

The **Lead Exposure Elimination Project** (**LEEP**) is a nonprofit organization that advocates for regulation of lead paint in low-income countries.

History
-------

LEEP launched in October 2020 with the help of a $60,000 incubation grant by [[Charity Entrepreneurship]].^[\[1\]](#fnbrtbkn4wbrs)^

Activities
----------

LEEP prioritizes work in countries where the problem of lead exposure is unusually tractable, neglected, and large-scale, and they currently focus on Malawi as the most promising country given those criteria. LEEP's activities so far have resulted in a commitment by the Malawi Bureau of Standards to implement a ban on lead paint.^[\[2\]](#fn0f829kd4wk1s)^

Impact
------

A [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness analysis]] by LEEP estimates that their intervention to implement lead paint regulation in Malawi has a cost per [[Adjusted life year|disability-adjusted life-year]] of approximately $14.^[\[3\]](#fn6dka7oxemim)^
