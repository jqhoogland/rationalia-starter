# Helen Keller International

**Helen Keller International** (**HKI**) is a nonprofit organization focused on preventing blindness and reducing malnutrition.

Activities
----------

HKI carries out over 120 programs in 21 countries around the world, including cataract surgery, vision correction, screening and treatment for diabetic retinopathy, distribution of treatments and cures for [[Neglected tropical diseases|neglected tropical diseases]], maternal and child nutrition education, and community-based management of acute malnutrition .^[\[1\]](#fny98d000b4ug)^ Charity evaluators within the effective altruism community have largely focused on HKI's vitamin A supplementation (VAS) program, which distributes vitamin A supplements in sub-Saharan Africa.

Evaluation
----------

As of July 2022, [[GiveWell]] estimates that HKI can deliver a vitamin A supplement at a cost of about $1, and that a donation to HKI's VAS program has an average [[Cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effectiveness]] of $3,500 per life saved.^[\[2\]](#fn1bk24hkiw5l)^^[\[3\]](#fnlmq152187zo)^^[\[4\]](#fnncxfo2wvtba)^ (The cost of distributing vitamin supplements is much lower than the cost of saving a life because a small fraction of people who receive supplementation would otherwise have died from conditions related to vitamin deficiency, and because of other factors.)^[\[3\]](#fnlmq152187zo)^

HKI's VAS program has been a GiveWell top-rated charity since 2017, and its cost-effectiveness is estimated to be in the same range as GiveWell's other priority programs.^[\[5\]](#fn5slker0nr4i)^ As of July 2022, HKI has received over $31 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[6\]](#fnac2yitiymqq)^ and is also featured in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[7\]](#fnrlc1zvbr0t)^
