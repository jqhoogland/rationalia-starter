# People for the Ethical Treatment of Reinforcement Learners

**People for the Ethical Treatment of Reinforcement Learners** (**PETRL**) is an organization focused on the welfare of AI agents.

History
-------

PETRL was founded by Daniel Filan, Buck Shlegeris, Jan Leike, Mayank Daswani, and others. A paper by [[Brian Tomasik]] on the ethics of reinforcement-learning agents inspired the creation of PETRL.^[\[1\]](#fndpymqljz8hi)^

PETRL was most active from 2014 to 2015.
