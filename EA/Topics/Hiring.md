# Hiring

The **hiring** tag is used for posts on hiring processes in EA (specific hiring rounds and/or general strategy used by EA orgs for hiring).

It can also cover discussion of how hiring happens at orgs outside of EA, if especially high-impact positions are available within those orgs (e.g. a post on hiring practices within the British government).
