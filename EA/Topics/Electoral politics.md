# Electoral politics

The **electoral politics** tag is used to discuss elections, how to make voting decisions, or the general impact of participating in electoral politics (e.g. how impactful it is to vote or volunteer during elections). For content specific to the USA, please use [[United States]] instead.

This is distinct from [[Electoral reform|electoral reform]], which is about how to change the system of electoral politics, and from [[Ballot initiative|ballot initiative]], which is about voting directly on legislation or referenda.
