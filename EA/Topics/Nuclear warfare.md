# Nuclear warfare

**Nuclear warfare** is military conflict involving the deployment of nuclear weapons.

Nuclear war is potentially the primary near-term [[Anthropogenic existential risk|anthropogenic existential risk]]. Nuclear war would probably not cause human extinction through the direct damage of an exchange. Rather, researchers are concerned about the potential for a [[Nuclear winter|nuclear winter]]: firestorms caused by the explosions could release particulate matter into the stratosphere, causing significant global cooling which would last for several years. This cooling would disrupt global agriculture, which would likely kill many more people than the initial exchange.^[\[1\]](#fnd6fpj0ycxki)^

However, there is some disagreement about how climate systems would react to the particulate matter and how much soot would actually be created (modern cities are potentially less vulnerable to firestorms than those during the cold war). As a result, it is unclear whether nuclear war poses an [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]] or a non-existential global catastrophic risk.
