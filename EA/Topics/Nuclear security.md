**Nuclear security** is the set of procedures, practices or other measures used to manage risks from nuclear [[Weapons of mass destruction|weapons]] and other nuclear materials.

Evaluation
----------

[[80,000 Hours]] rates nuclear security a "second-highest priority area": an unusually pressing global problem ranked slightly below their four highest priority areas.^[\[1\]](#fnqhws52z16v7)^

Recommendations
---------------

In [[The Precipice|*The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity*]], [[Toby Ord]] offers several [[Policy|policy]] and [[Research|research]] recommendations for handling risks from nuclear weapons:^[\[2\]](#fnu9nacjazuu)^

*   Restart the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).
*   Take US ICBMs off hair-trigger alert (officially called Launch on Warning).
*   Increase the capacity of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to verify nations are complying with safeguards agreements.
*   Work on resolving the key uncertainties in nuclear winter modeling.
*   Characterize the remaining uncertainties then use Monte Carlo techniques to show the distribution of outcome possibilities, with a special focus on the worst-case possibilities compatible with our current understanding.
*   Investigate which parts of the world appear most robust to the effects of nuclear winter and how likely civilization is to continue there.
