The discipline's main purpose is to determine the circumstances affecting [[Wild animal welfare|wild animal welfare]]. **Applied welfare biology**, in turn, is the application of welfare biology to identify interventions that affect the welfare of wild animals.^[\[1\]](#fn6vkgd8bk4m9)^ The field was established by economist [[Yew-Kwang Ng]] in a seminal 1995 paper.^[\[2\]](#fn8898a3mx0u5)^
