# Living Goods

**Living Goods** is a nonprofit organization that runs a network of micro-entrepreneurs, known as "community health providers" (CHPs), who sell health and household goods door-to-door in Uganda and Kenya and provide basic health counseling.

Evaluation
----------

A cluster [[Randomized controlled trials|randomized controlled trial]] found a 27% mortality decrease among young children in Ugandan villages visited by CHPs.^[\[1\]](#fndunwqch63x5)^ Partly on the basis of these findings, in 2014 [[GiveWell]] estimated Living Goods' cost per life saved to be in the range of $10,000,^[\[2\]](#fnd8korq50g58)^ and rated it a [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities) every year until 2021, when that designation was discontinued.^[\[2\]](#fnd8korq50g58)^ An update published in 2016 noted a few developments in the intervening period, but did not revise that estimate or alter its rating.^[\[3\]](#fn3x3q74msno6)^

As of July 2022, Living Goods has received $1.1 in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[4\]](#fnqaatziguqs)^ and is also featured in [[The Life You Can Save]]'s list of "best charities".^[\[5\]](#fn98xzojhjxo7)^
