# Funding request (open)

The **funding request** tag covers posts whose authors are looking for a grant or donation, whether to themselves or to their organization. The tag's purpose is to group posts of this type for would-be donors. 

After a request has been completed, or if it's no longer relevant, downvote this tag and add **requests (closed)**. This can be done by anyone, not just the original poster.
