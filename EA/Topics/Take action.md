# Take action

The [[Effective Altruism Forum|EA Forum]] is mostly about discussing ideas. But ultimately, the reason for discussing those ideas is to take actions that improve the world.

Here are some ways to get involved with effective altruism via the EA Forum or elsewhere:

*   **Jobs:** Find [[Job listing (open)|job listings on the Forum]], apply for [high-impact career advising](https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/), or visit the job boards on [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/job-board/) and [EA Work Club](https://eawork.club/)
*   **Volunteering**: Find volunteering opportunities using the [[Volunteering|volunteering]] tag, by visiting [EA Work Club](https://eawork.club/), by looking at the  [EA Opportunities Board](https://ea-internships.pory.app/board), or by directly reaching out to [high-impact non-profit organisations](https://givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities).
*   **Donating:** Support high-impact work by donating to [high impact causes](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas/) and taking an [effective giving pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/).
*   **Internships and fellowships:** Find [[Fellowships and internships|internships and fellowships on the Forum]] or visit the [EA Opportunities Board](https://ea-internships.pory.app/board), which lists everything short of full-time positions.
*   **Startup ideas:** Start a high impact non-profit by applying to [Charity Entrepreneurship](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/), finding a startup idea from this [list of ideas for valuable new non-profit startups](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/faezoENQwSTyw9iop/ea-megaprojects-continued) (of which there might already be [funding available](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/faezoENQwSTyw9iop/ea-megaprojects-continued?commentId=8N6ysMWesNbyfzsuJ#comments) if you want to try one of these ideas).
*   **Research ideas:** Find a research topic by looking at the [central directory for research questions](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MsNpJBzv5YhdfNHc9/a-central-directory-for-open-research-questions), or use [Effective Thesis](https://effectivethesis.org/) to help find a high-impact thesis topic.
*   **Funding opportunities:** Seek funding for a high-impact project by posting using the [[Funding opportunities|funding opportunity]] tag, applying to [the FTX Future Fund](https://ftxfuturefund.org/apply/), apply to [EA Funds](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/apply-for-funding), or find [other funding opportunities](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DqwxrdyQxcMQ8P2rD/list-of-ea-funding-opportunities).

(This page is an experiment: please [give us feedback](https://drive.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgvoD7WrLgmkdTebNs4QzooGB42iDWk9bDPYOd3-QWKOywrg/viewform) on it!)

Use the **take action** tag for posts that offer readers a way to get involved with useful EA work. It is a call to action, an option to volunteer, or anything else.

Ideally, this tag will only be applied to posts that discuss an active opportunity. If you see a post that has this tag, but the time to get involved has already passed, please downvote this tag's karma so that the post will no longer appear on the "get involved" tag page and upvote [[Requests (closed)|**requests (closed)**]] tag so that it will be clear that no one had mis-tagged.

For completable well-defined requests, use [[Requests (open)|**requests (open)**]] instead. For posts that seek funding use [[Funding request (open)|**funding request**]]. For invitations to future events use the [**Events page**](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/events).
