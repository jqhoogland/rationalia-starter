# Community

The **Community** tag covers posts about the EA community, as well as applying EA in one's personal life. The tag also applies to posts about the Forum itself, since this is a community space.

If you never touched that setting, or if you view the Forum while logged out, the weighting of community posts will be “-25” by default. (The algorithm will show posts with the Community tag less prominently, as though they all had 25 less karma.)
