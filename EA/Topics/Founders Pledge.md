# Founders Pledge

**Founders Pledge** is a nonprofit that encourages entrepreneurs to [[Donation pledge|pledge to donate]] a portion of their profits to [[Effective giving|effective charities]], and conducts [[Cause prioritization|cause prioritization]] and [[Charity evaluation|charity evaluation]] research to assist their members in deciding which organizations to support.

Founders Pledge Funds
---------------------

In 2020, Founders Pledge launched two Funds—expert-managed, cause-specific pools of money for regranting—: the **Global Health and Development Fund** and the **Climate Change Fund**.^[\[1\]](#fnnv7hp7436na)^^[\[2\]](#fntdizktlhw4)^

A third Fund was added in 2021: the **Patient Philanthropy Fund**. The purpose of this Fund is to invest the donations it receives by default, potentially for decades, centuries or millennia, until the managers conclude that an unusually high-impact opportunity exists to safeguard and improve humanity's long-term future. The Fund was launched with $1 million in pre-seed funding, with the goal of growing it to $100 million within the following 10 years.^[\[3\]](#fn2q6e1njjsun)^^[\[4\]](#fnmn7wr2kbgnr)^^[\[5\]](#fnt6kg9lgifa)^

Evaluation

As of May 2022, Founders Pledge has received over $8.7 million in funding from [[Open Philanthropy]],^[\[6\]](#fnxc3h21sj009)^ and nearly $720,000 from [[Effective Altruism Funds]].^[\[7\]](#fnvxp9q75mbcs)^^[\[8\]](#fnbac7ekt92r7)^^[\[9\]](#fn73yq7shui9s)^^[\[10\]](#fn7nup7l30cdk)^
