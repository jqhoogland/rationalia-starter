# Digital person

A **digital person** is a person running on digital computing hardware.

As [[Holden Karnofsky]] uses the term, "digital person" may refer to human [[Whole brain emulation|whole brain emulations]] as well as digital "descendants" of humans.^[\[1\]](#fnomjxn8g7a6)^ According to Karnofsky, digital people would have the same moral standing as humans (cf. [[Moral patienthood|moral patient]]), would accelerate [[Economic growth|economic growth]] and [[Scientific progress|scientific progress]], and could cause a [[Value lock-in|"lock-in" of values]].  For this reason, Karnofsky considers the emergence of digital people a [[Transformative development|transformative development]], as well as one that, because of advances in [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]], could occur this century—making it potentially [[Hinge of history|the most important one in human history]].^[\[2\]](#fnzn1rdhv7z1)^

    "The central case I'll focus on is that of digital people just like us, perhaps created via mind uploading (simulating human brains). However, one could also imagine entities unlike us in many ways, but still properly thought of as "descendants" of humanity; those would be digital people as well."
