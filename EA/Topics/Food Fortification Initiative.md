# Food Fortification Initiative

**Food Fortification Initiative** (**FFI**) is an organization that focuses on reducing [[Micronutrient deficiency|micronutrient deficiencies]] by helping country leaders plan, implement and monitor fortification programs.

Evaluation
----------

A review by [[GiveWell]] concluded that effective micronutrient fortification programs could be as cost-effective as their top-rated programs. Due to difficulties in assessing FFI's causal role in implementing their programs, however, GiveWell has not attempted an explicit cost-effectiveness analysis of this organization's impact.

Because of these uncertainties, GiveWell rated FFI a [standout charity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/givewell#Standout_charities)—an organization with exceptional potential for impact which does not fully meet all of the criteria to be rated a top charity. As GiveWell believes that further research is unlikely to resolve these uncertainties, it does not plan to conduct additional investigations on FFI for the time being.^[\[1\]](#fnirhowuwevw)^ FFI was a standout charity from 2016 to 2021, when that designation was discontinued. 

As of July 2022, FFI has received $600,000 in grants from [[Open Philanthropy]].^[\[2\]](#fn0032jpsisrobc)^
