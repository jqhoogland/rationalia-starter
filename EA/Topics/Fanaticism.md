# Fanaticism

**Fanaticism** is the apparent problem faced by moral theories that rank a minuscule probability of an arbitrarily large value above a guaranteed modest amount of value.^[\[1\]](#fnz3tbarlnff)^^[\[2\]](#fnt8dxz0a2u6p)^ Some have argued that fanatical theories should be rejected and that this might undermine the case for certain philosophical positions, such as [[EA/Topics/Longtermism|longtermism]].

See also [[Pascal's mugging]].
