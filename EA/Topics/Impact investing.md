# Impact investing

**Impact investing** is the practice of investing in for-profit companies with the intention of generating both financial returns and social impact. The theory is that impact investing can increase the capital available to a company, allowing it to generate more positive social outcomes than would otherwise have occurred.

For impact investing to do good, it has to provide a company with more capital than it would have otherwise received. This is often difficult unless the investment is *concessionary* (sacrifices some level of financial return against the market rate), or takes place in a private market which other investors are unable or unwilling to invest in.^[\[1\]](#fniqqnzp3p2lo)^

Impact investing is one form of [[Socially responsible investing|socially responsible investing]].
