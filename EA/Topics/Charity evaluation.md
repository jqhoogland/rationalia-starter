# Charity evaluation

**Charity evaluation** (or **charity assessment**) is the investigation of charities to determine whether they should receive funding. It often includes a mixture of quantitative [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effectiveness]] calculations and other considerations, such as the strength of the charity's team, their [[Theory of change|theory of change]], and their [[Room for more funding|room for more funding]].

**Charity evaluators** are organisations that have as one of their core activities conducting charity evaluations. Examples include [[GiveWell]], [[Animal Charity Evaluators]], [[The Life You Can Save]], [[Giving Green]], and [[Founders Pledge]]. But charity evaluation can also be done by other organisations with less focus on that or by individuals, either as part of their own [[Donation choice|donation choice]] or to help inform other people's donation choices.

There are also other types of funding opportunities that can be evaluated in similar ways, such as individuals, for-profits, academic institutes, think tanks, or other projects or organisations that are not formally registered as charities.^[\[1\]](#fnf5z4wxnmkig)^
