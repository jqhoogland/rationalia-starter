# Organization strategy

The **organization strategy** tag covers posts about running organizations well (whether for-profit or nonprofit).

If a post discusses running an EA group rather than another type of organization, please use the [[Effective altruism groups|effective altruism groups]] tag instead. (At some point, we may also add a separate "Group strategy" tag.)
