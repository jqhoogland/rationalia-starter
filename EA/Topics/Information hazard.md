# Information hazard

An **information hazard** (also known as an **infohazard**) is a risk arising from the spread of true information. The concept was introduced by [[Nick Bostrom]] in a 2011 paper.^[\[1\]](#fn8mouiuypb1)^

An important ethical and practical issue is how information hazards should be treated. To what extent should people suppress acquisition and dissemination of information which may cause harm? The answer to this question both depends on one’s moral views—for instance, whether new knowledge is good in itself, or whether it is wrong to restrict personal liberty—and on one’s empirical views of what the outcome of such suppression is likely to be.
