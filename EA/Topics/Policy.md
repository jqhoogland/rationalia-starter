# Policy

The **policy** topic is very broad, covering any post about improving government policy (in developing and developed countries alike).

Improving policy
----------------

Governments are typically committed to the notion that their policies should be effective. This means that members of the effective altruist community can be in a good position to help governments reach their aims. Moreover, the fact that governments are very powerful, and control significant proportions of world GDP, suggests that helping policy-makers can be a high-value strategy. This strategy can be pursued either from the *outside*—by effective altruist organizations which advise policy-makers—or from the *inside*—by policy-makers who try to do the most good possible.

Some of the highest-impact reforms affect people who are less able to advocate for their own interests, such as [[Criminal justice reform|prisoners]] or [[Immigration reform|migrants]]. Other policies, like [[Macroeconomic policy|macroeconomic policy]] and [[Land use reform|land use reform]], have effects that are somewhat diffuse and non-obvious, which makes it difficult to assemble groups to lobby for change. The more mainstream focus areas of [[Global poverty|global poverty and health]], [[Animal welfare|animal welfare]] and [[EA/Topics/Existential risk|existential risk]] could also be addressed using political advocacy.
