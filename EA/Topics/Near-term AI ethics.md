# Near-term AI ethics

**Near-term AI ethics** is the branch of [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|AI ethics]] that studies the moral questions arising from issues in AI that society is already facing or will likely face very soon. Examples include concerns about data privacy, algorithmic bias, self-driving cars, and [[Autonomous weapon|autonomous weapons]]. **Long-term AI ethics**, by contrast, is the branch of [[Ethics of artificial intelligence|AI ethics]] that studies the moral questions arising from issues expected to arise when AI is much more advanced than it is today. Examples include the implications of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial general intelligence]] or [[Transformative artificial intelligence|transformative artificial intelligence]].^[\[1\]](#fnrqqpfnudg)^^[\[2\]](#fni6hzj96ow3e)^
