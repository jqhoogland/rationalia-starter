# Global poverty

**Global poverty** is the worldwide lack of material possessions or income to satisfy basic human needs.

Poverty is a multidimensional concept, incorporating a number of different factors which impact the lives of the poor. The World Bank uses an international poverty line of $1.90 a day (adjusted for local purchasing power), and estimates that, in 2013, 10.7% of the world’s population lived below this line.^[\[1\]](#fn6gieyy3gh1j)^ Lack of economic resources has direct consequences on many other aspects of life, including [[Food security|food security]] and access to healthcare and water services.

[[Cash transfers]] and [[Deworming|deworming]] programs are generally regarded as highly cost-effective interventions for reducing extreme poverty.
