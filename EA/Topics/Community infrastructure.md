# Community infrastructure

**Community infrastructure** refers to potential and current community-wide products, tools, services or mechanisms that enable intra-community coordination.

This can include:

*   building tools or websites such as [[Wikis|wikis]], forums, tools, and platforms
*   offering cross-cutting services like shared services to EA organizations
*   offline events such as [[Conferences|conferences]], community houses, and regional networks
*   coordination tools such as [[Donor lotteries|donor lotteries]]

Some community infrastructure may be limited to certain subgroups, such as events and services for leaders but still provide benefits to the wider community.

Examples include: [[Effective Altruism Forum|EA Forum]], [[Effective Altruism Funds|EA Funds]], [[Effective Altruism Hub|EA Hub]], [[Effective Altruism Global|EA Global conferences]], Project incubation (e.g. [[Charity Entrepreneurship]]) and the international EA event calendar.

This is intended to be for infrastructure that serve the specific needs of the EA movement.
