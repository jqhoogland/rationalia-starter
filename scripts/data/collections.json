They describe how to avoid the typical failure modes of human reason and instead think in ways that more reliably lead to true and accurate beliefs. These essays are the foundational texts of [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bJ2haLkcGeLtTWaD5/welcome-to-lesswrong).\n\nTo provide a quick and accessible introduction to [The Sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality), we have selected 50 of the best essays that capture some of the seminal ideas. \n\n*Estimated read time of 8 hours.*\n\n*Art by Dall-E 2*"

At the end, the thousands of posts from a given year are narrowed down into approximately 50 posts.\n\nThose posts are collected in these Best Of LessWrong sequences.

The essays contained have been widely read within the rationality and effective altruism communities, and have a strong bias towards actually reading the scientific papers being discussed, analysing the arguments closely, and taking the conclusions seriously."

This collection serves as a long-form introduction to formative ideas behind Less Wrong, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, the Center for Applied Rationality, and substantial parts of the effective altruist community. Each book also comes with an introduction by Rob Bensinger and a supplemental essay by Yudkowsky.\n\nThe first two books, [Map and Territory](https://smile.amazon.com/Map-Territory-Rationality-Zombies-Book-ebook/dp/B07LDF7J3Q/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1546042059&sr=8-3&keywords=rationality+from+ai+to+zombies) and [How to Actually Change Your Mind](https://smile.amazon.com/Actually-Change-Your-Mind-Rationality/dp/1939311276/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1546042059&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=rationality+from+ai+to+zombies&psc=1), are available on Amazon (printed and e-book version).\n\n_The [entire collection](https://smile.amazon.com/Rationality-AI-Zombies-Eliezer-Yudkowsky-ebook/dp/B00ULP6EW2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1546042059&sr=8-2&keywords=rationality+from+ai+to+zombies) is available as an e-book and [audiobook](https://smile.amazon.com/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies/dp/B076ZX8SB6/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1546042059&sr=8-2).
