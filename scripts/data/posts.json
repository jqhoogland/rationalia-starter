We'll get in touch with winners and make a post about winning proposals sometime in the next month.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://alignmentresearchcenter.org/\"><u>ARC</u></a> recently released a technical report on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit\"><u>eliciting latent knowledge</u></a> (ELK), the focus of our current research. Roughly speaking, the goal of ELK is to incentivize ML models to honestly answer “straightforward” questions where the right answer is unambiguous and known by the model.&nbsp;</p><p>ELK is currently unsolved in the worst case—for every training strategy we’ve thought of so far, we can describe a case where an ML model trained with that strategy would give unambiguously bad answers to straightforward questions despite knowing better. Situations like this may or may not come up in practice, but nonetheless we are interested in finding a strategy for ELK for which we can’t think of <i>any </i>counterexample.</p><p>We think many people could potentially contribute to solving ELK—there’s a large space of possible training strategies and we’ve only explored a small fraction of them so far. Moreover, we think that trying to solve ELK in the worst case is a good way to “get into ARC’s headspace” and more deeply understand the research we do.</p><p><strong>We are offering prizes of $5,000 to $50,000 for proposed strategies for ELK.</strong> We’re planning to evaluate submissions received before February 15.</p><p>For full details of the ELK problem and several examples of possible strategies, see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit\"><u>the writeup</u></a>. The rest of this post will focus on how the contest works.</p><h2 id=\"Contest_details\">Contest details</h2><p><strong>To win a prize, you need to specify a training strategy for ELK that handles all of the counterexamples that we’ve described so far, summarized in the </strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals#Existing_counterexamples\"><strong>section below</strong></a>—i.e. where the breaker would need to specify something new about the test case to cause the strategy to break down.<strong> </strong>You don’t need to fully solve the problem in the worst case to win a prize, you just need to come up with a strategy that requires a new counterexample.</p><p>We’ll give a $5,000 prize to any proposal that we think clears this bar.<strong> </strong>We’ll give a $50,000 prize to a proposal which we haven’t considered and seems sufficiently promising to us or requires a new idea to break. We’ll give intermediate prizes for ideas that we think are promising but we’ve already considered, as well as for proposals that come with novel counterexamples, clarify some other aspect of the problem, or are interesting in other ways. A major purpose of the contest is to provide support for people understanding the problem well enough to start contributing; we aren’t trying to only reward ideas that are new to us.</p><p>You can submit multiple proposals, but we won’t give you separate prizes for each—we’ll give you at least the maximum prize that your best single submission would have received, but may not give much more than that.</p><p>If we receive multiple submissions based on a similar idea, we may post a comment describing the idea (with attribution) along with a counterexample. <strong>Once a counterexample has been included in the comments of this post, new submissions need to address that counterexample</strong> (as well as all the existing ones) in order to be eligible for a prize.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately prizes are awarded at our discretion, and the “rules of the game” aren’t fully precise. If you are curious about whether you are on the right track, feel free to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org\"><u>elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org</u></a> with the basic outline of an idea, and if we have time we’ll get back to you with some feedback. <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals#Rough_guidance\">Below</a> we also describe some of the directions we consider more and less promising and some general guidance.</p><h2 id=\"How_to_submit_a_proposal\">How to submit a proposal</h2><p>You can submit a proposal by copying this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnA1gictQmgT2J28oLsy0e5mBRpjHRww7IgapPcmSLk/edit?usp=sharing\">google doc template</a> and sharing it with <a href=\"mailto:elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org\"><u>elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org</u></a> (please give comment access in case we need to ask questions to evaluate your submission). By submitting a proposal, you are giving us permission to post the idea here with attribution. (And it's fine for you to post it after the contest or we post a counterexample.)</p><h2 id=\"Retroactive_prizes\">Retroactive prizes</h2><p>We’re giving prizes to existing proposals from <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=oryP2WHskCHd5c8vk\"><u>David Dalrymple</u></a> ($5k), <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=eKaHnMkktCYL4D6vi\"><u>Ramana Kumar</u></a> ($3k), <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/H7v5yyXAmmgu9DJmi/eliciting-latent-knowledge-via-hypothetical-sensors\"><u>John Maxwell</u></a> ($2k), and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=KQy3rDN34Lcp87JJs\"><u>Yonadav Shavit</u></a> ($1k). We’ve added relevant counterexamples in the next section, and further submissions need to handle those counterexamples in order to be eligible.</p><h2 id=\"Existing_counterexamples\">Existing counterexamples</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.n4dv0x4y10s6\"><u>our report</u></a> and a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FnZws8NuKw6BJzmvZ/counterexamples-to-some-elk-proposals\"><u>recent post</u></a>, we described some features of the world that would cause existing approaches to ELK to fail. A new approach should work even in a situation satisfying all of these properties, or should include an argument for why some of these features are actually impossible or inconsistent with each other.</p><p>In order to generate a counterexample to a training strategy, we need to spell out a concrete “way the world could be” (a test case) where the strategy would fail. In the report we consider test cases where the AI and the human happen to understand the world by doing inference in Bayes nets. <strong>The Bayes net case is just one test case that lets us get precise about our counterexamples and our training strategies don’t lean on it</strong>. In practice we also consider other concrete cases (e.g. deduction from premises generated by a neural network).</p><p>In this section we’ll briefly review the current state of existing counterexamples. This isn’t intended to be a self-contained description; it relies heavily on links to the report.</p><h3 id=\"Ontology_mismatch\">Ontology mismatch</h3><p>All of our counterexamples are based on an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.j976r9hpfgml\"><u>ontology mismatch</u></a> between two different Bayes nets, one used by an ML prediction model (“the predictor”) and one used by a human:</p><ul><li>The predictor’s Bayes net is used internally by a prediction model that maps an initial segment of a video to a prediction about what will happen next. This model was trained by gradient descent based on the quality of its predictions (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.wl2jla5mfdec\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>Humans have their own model of the world, which they can improve with the help of AI assistants; those assistants can design and conduct experiments, find and evaluate arguments, and so on. Crucially, we have a limited computational budget with which to train these AI assistants, and that limits how much help they can provide.

      "markdown": "**We are no longer accepting submissions. We'll get in touch with winners and make a post about winning proposals sometime in the next month.**\n\n[ARC](https://alignmentresearchcenter.org/) recently released a technical report on [eliciting latent knowledge](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit) (ELK), the focus of our current research. Roughly speaking, the goal of ELK is to incentivize ML models to honestly answer “straightforward” questions where the right answer is unambiguous and known by the model. \n\nELK is currently unsolved in the worst case—for every training strategy we’ve thought of so far, we can describe a case where an ML model trained with that strategy would give unambiguously bad answers to straightforward questions despite knowing better. Situations like this may or may not come up in practice, but nonetheless we are interested in finding a strategy for ELK for which we can’t think of *any* counterexample.\n\nWe think many people could potentially contribute to solving ELK—there’s a large space of possible training strategies and we’ve only explored a small fraction of them so far. Moreover, we think that trying to solve ELK in the worst case is a good way to “get into ARC’s headspace” and more deeply understand the research we do.\n\n**We are offering prizes of $5,000 to $50,000 for proposed strategies for ELK.** We’re planning to evaluate submissions received before February 15.\n\nFor full details of the ELK problem and several examples of possible strategies, see [the writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit). The rest of this post will focus on how the contest works.\n\nContest details\n---------------\n\n**To win a prize, you need to specify a training strategy for ELK that handles all of the counterexamples that we’ve described so far, summarized in the** [**section below**](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals#Existing_counterexamples)—i.e. where the breaker would need to specify something new about the test case to cause the strategy to break down.  You don’t need to fully solve the problem in the worst case to win a prize, you just need to come up with a strategy that requires a new counterexample.\n\nWe’ll give a $5,000 prize to any proposal that we think clears this bar.  We’ll give a $50,000 prize to a proposal which we haven’t considered and seems sufficiently promising to us or requires a new idea to break. We’ll give intermediate prizes for ideas that we think are promising but we’ve already considered, as well as for proposals that come with novel counterexamples, clarify some other aspect of the problem, or are interesting in other ways. A major purpose of the contest is to provide support for people understanding the problem well enough to start contributing; we aren’t trying to only reward ideas that are new to us.\n\nYou can submit multiple proposals, but we won’t give you separate prizes for each—we’ll give you at least the maximum prize that your best single submission would have received, but may not give much more than that.\n\nIf we receive multiple submissions based on a similar idea, we may post a comment describing the idea (with attribution) along with a counterexample. **Once a counterexample has been included in the comments of this post, new submissions need to address that counterexample** (as well as all the existing ones) in order to be eligible for a prize. \n\nUltimately prizes are awarded at our discretion, and the “rules of the game” aren’t fully precise. If you are curious about whether you are on the right track, feel free to send an email to [elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org](mailto:elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org) with the basic outline of an idea, and if we have time we’ll get back to you with some feedback. [Below](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals#Rough_guidance) we also describe some of the directions we consider more and less promising and some general guidance.\n\nHow to submit a proposal\n------------------------\n\nYou can submit a proposal by copying this [google doc template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnA1gictQmgT2J28oLsy0e5mBRpjHRww7IgapPcmSLk/edit?usp=sharing) and sharing it with [elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org](mailto:elk@alignmentresearchcenter.org) (please give comment access in case we need to ask questions to evaluate your submission). By submitting a proposal, you are giving us permission to post the idea here with attribution. (And it's fine for you to post it after the contest or we post a counterexample.)\n\nRetroactive prizes\n------------------\n\nWe’re giving prizes to existing proposals from [David Dalrymple](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=oryP2WHskCHd5c8vk) ($5k), [Ramana Kumar](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=eKaHnMkktCYL4D6vi) ($3k), [John Maxwell](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/H7v5yyXAmmgu9DJmi/eliciting-latent-knowledge-via-hypothetical-sensors) ($2k), and [Yonadav Shavit](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge?commentId=KQy3rDN34Lcp87JJs) ($1k). We’ve added relevant counterexamples in the next section, and further submissions need to handle those counterexamples in order to be eligible.\n\nExisting counterexamples\n------------------------\n\nIn [our report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.n4dv0x4y10s6) and a [recent post](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FnZws8NuKw6BJzmvZ/counterexamples-to-some-elk-proposals), we described some features of the world that would cause existing approaches to ELK to fail. A new approach should work even in a situation satisfying all of these properties, or should include an argument for why some of these features are actually impossible or inconsistent with each other.\n\nIn order to generate a counterexample to a training strategy, we need to spell out a concrete “way the world could be” (a test case) where the strategy would fail. In the report we consider test cases where the AI and the human happen to understand the world by doing inference in Bayes nets. **The Bayes net case is just one test case that lets us get precise about our counterexamples and our training strategies don’t lean on it**. In practice we also consider other concrete cases (e.g. deduction from premises generated by a neural network).\n\nIn this section we’ll briefly review the current state of existing counterexamples. This isn’t intended to be a self-contained description; it relies heavily on links to the report.\n\n### Ontology mismatch\n\nAll of our counterexamples are based on an [ontology mismatch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.j976r9hpfgml) between two different Bayes nets, one used by an ML prediction model (“the predictor”) and one used by a human:\n\n*   The predictor’s Bayes net is used internally by a prediction model that maps an initial segment of a video to a prediction about what will happen next. This model was trained by gradient descent based on the quality of its predictions ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.wl2jla5mfdec)).\n*   Humans have their own model of the world, which they can improve with the help of AI assistants; those assistants can design and conduct experiments, find and evaluate arguments, and so on. Crucially, we have a limited computational budget with which to train these AI assistants, and that limits how much help they can provide. The “human’s” Bayes net captures everything the human understands about the world at the end of this process ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.3l614s96sz9t)).\n\nWe are interested in the case where there are features of reality that are accurately reflected in the predictor’s Bayes net, but missing from this (augmented) human Bayes net. We expect the human could understand these facts *eventually* given enough time or enough AI assistance, but not using the available computational budget. Put differently, there is a gap between the kinds of understanding that gradient descent can build, and the kind of understanding that a human-comprehensible process of “scientific inquiry” can build using similar computational resources ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.kd79zkls9g5o)).\n\nFurthermore, we imagine that both the predictor’s Bayes net and the human’s Bayes net reflect some underlying reality and that there is a way to map between them, which we’ll call “direct translation.” We don’t know how to do direct translation, and we are concerned that if we simply search for *any* mapping from the AI’s Bayes net to the human’s Bayes net we will instead get the “human simulator”: the map which correctly translates the observations from one Bayes net to the other, but then does inference in the human’s Bayes net in order to fill in the latent structure as a human would by looking at the data ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.pvrv5q8nf2s2)).\n\n### Counterexample features\n\nELK seems particularly hard when these Bayes nets satisfy the following properties:\n\n1.  There are arbitrarily severe “ontology mismatches” between the predictor’s Bayes net and the human’s Bayes net, such that specifying the direct translation between them can be very complex ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.b93ykmpkp55y)).\n2.  The human’s Bayes net is simpler than the predictor’s Bayes net, and the gap can be arbitrarily large ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.b93ykmpkp55y)).\n3.  The predictor’s Bayes net is arbitrarily large, and individual nodes of the human’s Bayes net depend on a constant fraction of the predictor’s Bayes net. Therefore directly translating between the two Bayes nets takes arbitrarily much computation ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.xmyfigr32013)).\n4.  It’s computationally easy for the human simulator to do good inference in the human’s Bayes net—at least good enough inference that it answers questions as well as the direct translator—and the gap between this complexity and the complexity of direct translation can be arbitrarily large. More precisely, a human interrogator can’t think of questions which require the human simulator to do hard inference. However, we can’t rule out the possibility that you, the algorithm-designer, will think of some trick they can use to generate hard questions ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.xmyfigr32013)).\n5.  There are situations where a model which is trying to answer a question will *first* be able to predict what (potentially mistaken) belief the human-with-assistance will have about that question before it knows the true answer to the question ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.r6bak7fxz8w4)).\n6.  While the predictor’s Bayes net is very *large*, it has a short succinct description which is simpler than the human’s Bayes net, and that gap is arbitrarily large. Think of simple physical laws that describe arbitrarily computationally expensive simulations, or simple cognitive heuristics that are very widely applicable. ([more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit#heading=h.37r5bqctmv5q))\n7.  There are sequences of actions for which the predictor’s Bayes net correctly anticipates that tampering will occur yet nothing looks suspicious to the human’s Bayes net.\n8.  After tampering has occurred, it is possible that no sequence of further actions reveal that anything is wrong, e.g. the camera and actuators may have been completely disconnected from the world and replaced with a convincing-to-humans simulation ([more](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FnZws8NuKw6BJzmvZ/counterexamples-to-some-elk-proposals#Worry_1__there_is_no_experiment_that_reveals_the_problem)).\n9.  There are sequences of actions leading to undetectable tampering that have no human-comprehensible similarities to sequences of actions leading to detectable tampering; in particular, the early steps of this undetectable tampering cannot be used to perform detectable tampering ([more](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/FnZws8NuKw6BJzmvZ/counterexamples-to-some-elk-proposals#Worry__action_sequences_may_be_brittle)).\n\nAn important and very general strategy for the breaker is to suggest counterexamples where you “get what you train for.” If you propose training a model using loss function L, then the breaker will likely focus on counterexamples where the model chooses its output to minimize L. A successful approach should either explain why this either isn’t a realistic thing for the model to learn (e.g. why that would be disfavored by regularization), or why the overall approach works even if the model is explicitly strategizing about how to minimize the loss.\n\nRough guidance\n--------------\n\n*   There is a tradeoff between specifying your approach precisely, and including your own counterexample. It’s fine to describe a very broad/vague idea for solving ELK, and then present a new counterexample showing why that whole category of solutions can’t work. But if you don’t propose a counterexample, then it’s good to describe your proposal precisely enough that we understand how to actually implement it without wondering if that’s really what you meant.

      "markdown": "One or two research groups have published work on carbon dioxide and cognition. The state of the published literature is confusing.\n\n[Here](http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104789/) is one paper on the topic. The authors investigate a proprietary cognitive benchmark, and experimentally manipulate carbon dioxide levels (without affecting other measures of air quality). They find implausibly large effects from increased carbon dioxide concentrations.\n\nIf the reported effects are real and the suggested interpretation is correct, I think it would be a big deal. To put this in perspective, carbon dioxide concentrations in my room vary between 500 and 1500 ppm depending on whether I open the windows. The experiment reports on cognitive effects for moving from 600 and 1000 ppm, and finds significant effects compared to interindividual differences.\n\nI haven't spent much time looking into this (maybe 30 minutes, and another 30 minutes to write this post). I expect that if we spent some time looking into indoor CO2 we could have a much better sense of what was going on, by some combination of better literature review, discussion with experts, looking into the benchmark they used, and just generally thinking about it.\n\nSo, here's a proposal:\n\n*   If someone looks into this and writes a post that improves our collective understanding of the issue, I will be willing to buy part of an associated [certificate of impact](http://rationalaltruist.com/2014/11/15/certificates-of-impact/), at a price of around $100*N, where N is my own totally made up estimate of how many hours of my own time it would take to produce a similarly useful writeup. I'd buy up to 50% of the certificate at that price.\n*   Whether or not they want to sell me some of the certificate, on May 1 I'll give a $500 prize to the author of the best publicly-available analysis of the issue. If the best analysis draws heavily on someone else's work, I'll use my discretion: I may split the prize arbitrarily, and may give it to the earlier post even if it is not quite as excellent.\n\nSome clarifications:\n\n*   The metric for quality is \"how useful it is to Paul.\" I hope that's a useful proxy for how useful it is in general, but no guarantees. I am generally a pretty skeptical person. I would care a lot about even a modest but well-established effect on performance.\n*   These don't need to be new analyses, either for the prize or the purchase.\n*   I reserve the right to resolve all ambiguities arbitrarily, and in the end to do whatever I feel like. But I promise I am generally a nice guy.\n*   I posted this 2 weeks ago [on the EA forum](http://effective-altruism.com/ea/vn/what_is_up_with_carbon_dioxide_and_cognition_an/) and haven't had serious takers yet.\n\n(Thanks to Andrew Critch for mentioning these results to me and Jessica Taylor for lending me a CO2 monitor so that I could see variability in indoor CO2 levels. I apologize for deliberately not doing my homework on this post.)"

      "markdown": "*\\[cross-posted from my blog* [*Astral Codex Ten*](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/eight-hundred-slightly-poisoned-word)*\\]*\n\nIn 2012, a Berkeley team found that indoor carbon dioxide had dramatic negative effects on cognition ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3548274/), [popular article](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/summer-2016-welcome-there/your-brain-carbon-dioxide-research-finds-even-low)). Subjects in poorly ventilated environments did up to 50% worse on a test of reasoning and decision-making. This is potentially pretty important, because lots of office buildings (and private houses) count as poorly-ventilated environments, so a lot of decision-making might be happening while severely impaired.\n\nSince then people have debated this on and off, with [some studies](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/27662232/4892924.pdf?sequence=1) confirming the effect and [others](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ina.12284) failing to find it. I personally am skeptical, partly because the effect is so big I would expect someone to have noticed, but also because submarines, spaceships, etc have orders of magnitude more carbon dioxide than any civilian environment, but people still seem to do pretty hard work in them pretty effectively.\n\nAs part of my continuing effort to test this theory in my own life, I played a word game eight hundred times under varying ventilation conditions.\n\n…okay, fine, no, I admit it, I played a word game eight hundred times because I’m addicted to it. But since I was playing the word game eight hundred times anyway, I varied the ventilation conditions to see what would happen.\n\nThe game was WordTwist, which you can find [here](https://wordtwist.puzzlebaron.com/init5.php) (warning: potentially addictive). You get a 5x5 square of letters and you have to find as many words as possible (of four letters or more) within three minutes. You can move up, down, right, left, or diagonal, and get more points for harder words. A typical board looks like this:\n\n![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1902078a-2b4f-4f8d-8b6c-7a8122700660_298x299.png)\n\nDid you spot “lace”? What about “intrapsychically”?\n\nI played this game about 5-10x/day over three months. During this time, the carbon dioxide monitor in my room recorded levels between 445 ppm (with all windows open and the fan on) and 3208 ppm (with all windows closed and several people crammed into the room for several hours). I discounted a stray reading of 285 as an outlier, since this is climatologically impossible (I’m not claiming my monitor is perfectly calibrated, just that it clearly shows higher levels when my room is less well ventilated). CO2 445 is basically the same as outdoors; 3208 is considered extremely poor air quality, likely to cause headaches, nausea, and other minor ailments. The Berkeley study looked at levels between 600 and 2500, so my range was comparable to theirs.\n\nI correlated my adjusted score (my score as a percent of the average score for that board) for each game with the CO2 level in my room when I was playing it. R was 0.001, p = 0.97 - there was absolutely no correlation.\n\nWhy might these results not be valid? Well, CO2 level in my room wasn’t randomly determined - I just played a game when I felt like it and recorded whatever the ambient CO2 level was at the time. CO2 level was lower if I had the window open or air conditioning on, higher if I’d been in the room for a long time, and highest if I’d just woken up after being asleep in the room all night. It was also higher when other people were in my room. In theory things like this could confound the results. For example, if CO2 really did affect performance, but I performed better when I was hot, then turning the air conditioning on might improve performance (by decreasing CO2) but also hurt performance (by making it colder), and those effects could cancel out. Or if I performed worse after exercise, and I often went out of my room to exercise, then I might perform worse when I had just come back into my room (which was often when CO2 was lowest).\n\nIn practice I’m skeptical this mattered. For one thing, the studies found huge positive effects - so for me to find zero effect would require a huge negative effect of the *exact* right size to cancel out the huge positive one. For another thing, I checked if temperature had any effect, and it didn’t (r = -0.008, p = 0.83). For another, I ran a few controlled experiments to see if they got the same results as the naturalistic ones, and they did. For another, I did get to test an exogenous shock - about halfway through the experiment, I moved to a new house with better ventilation. The difference in average CO2 reading between the old and new houses was significant (p < 0.001), but the difference in score wasn’t (p = 0.15). Although it was in the expected direction (new house > old), I attribute this to me improving on the word game with practice, and I didn’t improve any more during the month when I switched houses than in an average month.\n\nI consider this to be very strong evidence that at least for me, on this specific task, carbon dioxide has zero effect on cognition. To rescue the hypothesis that it matters, you’d either have to find that it affects other people more than it does me (why would it?) or that it affects other aspects of cognition more than it affects the skills associated with this particular word game. This second one is moderately plausible - I don’t think the word game tests “decision-making” per se. But it would be surprising for this not to be a general health effect, and would potentially be important in the study of intelligence and neuroscience to explore which skills do or don’t suffer under carbon dioxide poisoning.\n\nI was excited to read the Less Wrong post [Chess and cheap ways to check day to day variance in cognition](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nvRauqCD3u5hdkLm9/chess-and-cheap-ways-to-check-day-to-day-variance-in) by KPier, who does something similar with chess instead of a word game; they haven’t checked carbon dioxide levels yet, but I’d be excited for them to try. I’m also interested in hearing from anyone else who often repeats some objectively-scoreable cognitive task, to see how they do. A CO2 monitor [costs about $100 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2UWhbbM), but if money is the only reason you’re not going to do some really good experiment, please let me know and I’ll buy it for you.\n\nIf you’re planning on testing this, please post about it below as a form of preregistration.\n\n**EDIT:** You can download the original data [here](http://slatestarcodex.com/Stuff/CO2data.xlsx), some explanations of what the columns mean [here](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/eight-hundred-slightly-poisoned-word/comments#comment-2574198)."

      "markdown": "**Follow-up to:** [Security Mindset and Ordinary Paranoia](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/8gqrbnW758qjHFTrH/security-mindset-and-ordinary-paranoia)\n\n* * *\n\n(_Two days later, Amber returns with another question._)\n\namber:  Uh, say, Coral. How important is security mindset when you're building a whole new kind of system—say, one subject to potentially adverse optimization pressures, where you want it to have some sort of robustness property?\n\ncoral:  How novel is the system?\n\namber:  Very novel.\n\ncoral:  Novel enough that you'd have to invent your own new best practices instead of looking them up?\n\namber:  Right.\n\ncoral:  That's serious business. If you're building a very simple Internet-connected system, maybe a smart ordinary paranoid could look up how we usually guard against adversaries, use as much off-the-shelf software as possible that was checked over by real security professionals, and not do too horribly. But if you're doing something qualitatively new and complicated that has to be robust against adverse optimization, well... mostly I'd think you were operating in almost impossibly dangerous territory, and I'd advise you to figure out what to do after your first try failed. But if you wanted to actually succeed, ordinary paranoia absolutely would not do it.\n\namber:  In other words, projects to build novel mission-critical systems ought to have advisors with the full security mindset, so that the advisor can say what the system builders really need to do to ensure security.\n\ncoral:  (_laughs sadly_)  No.\n\namber:  No?\n\ncoral:  Let's say for the sake of concreteness that you want to build a new kind of secure operating system. That is _not_ the sort of thing you can do by attaching one advisor with security mindset, who has limited political capital to use to try to argue people into doing things. “Building a house when you're only allowed to touch the bricks using tweezers” comes to mind as a metaphor. You're going to need experienced security professionals working full-time with high authority. Three of them, one of whom is a cofounder. Although even then, we might still be operating in the territory of Paul Graham's Design Paradox.\n\namber:  Design Paradox? What's that?\n\ncoral:  Paul Graham's Design Paradox is that people who have good taste in UIs can tell when other people are designing good UIs, but most CEOs of big companies lack the good taste to tell who else has good taste. And that's why big companies can't just hire other people as talented as Steve Jobs to build nice things for them, even though Steve Jobs certainly wasn't the best possible designer on the planet. Apple existed because of a lucky history where Steve Jobs ended up in charge. There's no way for Samsung to hire somebody else with equal talents, because Samsung would just end up with some guy in a suit who was good at pretending to be Steve Jobs in front of a CEO who couldn't tell the difference.\n\nSimilarly, people with security mindset can notice when other people lack it, but I'd worry that an ordinary paranoid would have a hard time telling the difference, which would make it hard for them to hire a truly competent advisor. And of course lots of the people in the larger social system behind technology projects lack even the ordinary paranoia that many good programmers possess, and they just end up with empty suits talking a lot about “risk” and “safety”. In other words, if we're talking about something as hard as building a secure operating system, and your project hasn't started up _already_ headed up by someone with the full security mindset, you are in trouble. Where by “in trouble” I mean “totally, irretrievably doomed”.\n\namber:  Look, uh, there's a certain project I'm invested in which has raised a hundred million dollars to create merchant drones.\n\ncoral:  Merchant drones?\n\namber:  So there are a lot of countries that have poor market infrastructure, and the idea is, we're going to make drones that fly around buying and selling things, and they'll use machine learning to figure out what prices to pay and so on. We're not just in it for the money; we think it could be a huge economic boost to those countries, really help them move forwards.\n\ncoral:  Dear God. Okay. There are exactly two things your company is about: system security, and regulatory compliance. Well, and also marketing, but that doesn't count because every company is about marketing. It would be a severe error to imagine that your company is about anything else, such as drone hardware or machine learning.\n\namber:  Well, the sentiment inside the company is that the time to begin thinking about legalities and security will be after we've proven we can build a prototype and have at least a small pilot market in progress. I mean, until we know how people are using the system and how the software ends up working, it's hard to see how we could do any productive thinking about security or compliance that wouldn't just be pure speculation.\n\ncoral:  Ha! Ha, hahaha… oh my god you're not joking.\n\namber:  What?\n\ncoral:  Please tell me that what you actually mean is that you have a security and regulatory roadmap which calls for you to do some of your work later, but clearly lays out what work needs to be done, when you are to start doing it, and when each milestone needs to be complete. Surely you don't _literally_ mean that you _intend to start thinking about it_ later?\n\namber:  A lot of times at lunch we talk about how annoying it is that we'll have to deal with regulations and how much better it would be if governments were more libertarian. That counts as thinking about it, right?\n\ncoral:  Oh my god.\n\namber:  I don't see how we could have a security plan when we don't know exactly what we'll be securing. Wouldn't the plan just turn out to be wrong?\n\ncoral:  All business plans for startups turn out to be wrong, but you still need them—and not just as works of fiction. They represent the written form of your current beliefs about your key assumptions. Writing down your business plan checks whether your current beliefs can possibly be coherent, and suggests which critical beliefs to test first, and which results should set off alarms, and when you are falling behind key survival thresholds. The idea isn't that you stick to the business plan; it's that having a business plan (a) checks that it seems possible to succeed in any way whatsoever, and (b) tells you when one of your beliefs is being falsified so you can explicitly change the plan and adapt. Having a written plan that you intend to rapidly revise in the face of new information is one thing. _NOT HAVING A PLAN_ is _another_.\n\namber:  The thing is, I _am_ a little worried that the head of the project, Mr. Topaz, isn't concerned enough about the possibility of somebody fooling the drones into giving out money when they shouldn't. I mean, I've tried to raise that concern, but he says that of course we're not going to program the drones to give out money to just anyone. Can you maybe give him a few tips? For when it comes time to start thinking about security, I mean.\n\ncoral:  Oh. Oh, my dear, sweet summer child, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do for you.\n\namber:  Huh? But you haven't even looked at our beautiful business model!\n\ncoral:  I thought maybe your company merely had a hopeless case of underestimated difficulties and misplaced priorities. But now it sounds like your leader is not even using ordinary paranoia, and reacts with skepticism to it. Calling a case like that “hopeless” would be an understatement.\n\namber:  But a security failure would be very bad for the countries we're trying to help! They need _secure_ merchant drones!\n\ncoral:  Then they will need drones built by some project that is not led by Mr. Topaz.\n\namber:  But that seems very hard to arrange!\n\ncoral:  ...I don't understand what you are saying that is supposed to contradict anything I am saying.\n\namber:  Look, aren't you judging Mr. Topaz a little too quickly? Seriously.\n\ncoral:  I haven't met him, so it's possible you misrepresented him to me. But if you've accurately represented his attitude? Then, yes, I did judge quickly, but it's a hell of a good guess. Security mindset is already rare on priors. “I don't plan to make my drones give away money to random people” means he's imagining how his system could work as he intends, instead of imagining how it might not work as he intends. If somebody doesn't even exhibit ordinary paranoia, spontaneously on their own cognizance without external prompting, then they cannot do security, period. Reacting indignantly to the suggestion that something might go wrong is even beyond that level of hopelessness, but the base level was hopeless enough already.\n\namber:  Look... can you just go to Mr. Topaz and try to tell him what he needs to do to add some security onto his drones? Just try? Because it's super important.\n\ncoral:  I could try, yes. I can't succeed, but I could try.\n\namber:  Oh, but please be careful to not be harsh with him. Don’t put the focus on what he’s doing wrong—and try to make it clear that these problems aren’t _too_ serious. He's been put off by the media alarmism surrounding apocalyptic scenarios with armies of evil drones filling the sky, and it took me some trouble to convince him that I wasn't just another alarmist full of fanciful catastrophe scenarios of drones defying their own programming.\n\ncoral:  ...\n\namber:  And maybe try to keep your opening conversation away from what might sound like crazy edge cases, like somebody forgetting to check the end of a buffer and an adversary throwing in a huge string of characters that overwrite the end of the stack with a return address that jumps to a section of code somewhere else in the system that does something the adversary wants. I mean, you've convinced me that these far-fetched scenarios are worth worrying about, if only because they might be canaries in the coal mine for more realistic failure modes. But Mr. Topaz thinks that's all a bit silly, and I don't think you should open by trying to explain to him on a meta level why it isn't. He'd probably think you were being condescending, telling him how to think. Especially when you're just an operating-systems guy and you have no experience building drones and seeing what actually makes them crash. I mean, that's what I think he'd say to you.\n\ncoral:  ...\n\namber:  Also, start with the cheaper interventions when you're giving advice. I don't think Mr. Topaz is going to react well if you tell him that he needs to start all over in another programming language, or establish a review board for all code changes, or whatever. He's worried about competitors reaching the market first, so he doesn't want to do anything that will slow him down.\n\ncoral:  ...\n\namber:  Uh, Coral?\n\ncoral:  ... on his novel project, entering new territory, doing things not exactly like what has been done before, carrying out novel mission-critical subtasks for which there are no standardized best security practices, nor any known understanding of what makes the system robust or not-robust.\n\namber:  Right!\n\ncoral:  And Mr. Topaz himself does not seem much terrified of this terrifying task before him.\n\namber:  Well, he's worried about somebody else making merchant drones first and misusing this key economic infrastructure for bad purposes. That's the same basic thing, right? Like, it demonstrates that he can worry about things?\n\ncoral:  It is utterly different. Monkeys who can be afraid of other monkeys getting to the bananas first are far, far more common than monkeys who worry about whether the bananas will exhibit weird system behaviors in the face of adverse optimization.\n\namber:  Oh.\n\ncoral:  I'm afraid it is only slightly more probable that Mr. Topaz will oversee the creation of robust software than that the Moon will spontaneously transform into organically farmed goat cheese.\n\namber:  I think you're being too harsh on him. I've met Mr. Topaz, and he seemed pretty bright to me.\n\ncoral:  Again, assuming you're representing him accurately, Mr. Topaz seems to lack what I called ordinary paranoia. If he does have that ability as a cognitive capacity, which many bright programmers do, then he obviously doesn't feel passionate about applying that paranoia to his drone project along key dimensions. It also sounds like Mr. Topaz doesn't realize there's a skill that he is missing, and would be insulted by the suggestion. I am put in mind of the story of the farmer who was asked by a passing driver for directions to get to Point B, to which the farmer replied, “If I was trying to get to Point B, I sure wouldn't start from here.”\n\namber:  Mr. Topaz has made some significant advances in drone technology, so he can't be stupid, right?\n\ncoral:  \"Security mindset\" seems to be a distinct cognitive talent from _g_ factor or even programming ability. In fact, there doesn’t seem to be a level of human genius that even guarantees you’ll be skilled at ordinary paranoia. Which does make some security professionals feel a bit weird, myself included—the same way a lot of programmers have trouble understanding why not everyone can learn to program. But it seems to be an observational fact that both ordinary paranoia and security mindset are things that can decouple from _g_ factor and programming ability—and if this were not the case, the Internet would be far more secure than it is.\n\namber:  Do you think it would help if we talked to the other VCs funding this project and got them to ask Mr. Topaz to appoint a Special Advisor on Robustness reporting directly to the CTO? That sounds politically difficult to me, but it's possible we could swing it. Once the press started speculating about drones going rogue and maybe aggregating into larger Voltron-like robots that could acquire laser eyes, Mr. Topaz did tell the VCs that he was very concerned about the ethics of drone safety and that he'd had many long conversations about it over lunch hours.\n\ncoral:  I'm venturing slightly outside my own expertise here, which isn't corporate politics per se. But on a project like this one that's trying to enter novel territory, I'd guess the person with security mindset needs at least cofounder status, and must be personally trusted by any cofounders who don't have the skill. It can't be an outsider who was brought in by VCs, who is operating on limited political capital and needs to win an argument every time she wants to not have all the services conveniently turned on by default. I suspect you just have the wrong person in charge of this startup, and that this problem is not repairable.\n\namber:  Please don't just give up! Even if things are as bad as you say, just increasing our project's probability of being secure from 0% to 10% would be very valuable in expectation to all those people in other countries who need merchant drones.\n\ncoral:  ...look, at some point in life we have to try to triage our efforts and give up on what can't be salvaged. There's often a logistic curve for success probabilities, you know? The distances are measured in multiplicative odds, not additive percentage points. You can't take a project like this and assume that by putting in some more hard work, you can increase the absolute chance of success by 10%. More like, the odds of this project's failure versus success start out as 1,000,000:1, and if we're very polite and navigate around Mr. Topaz's sense that he is higher-status than us and manage to explain a few tips to him without ever sounding like we think we know something he doesn't, we can quintuple his chances of success and send the odds to 200,000:1. Which is to say that in the world of percentage points, the odds go from 0.0% to 0.0%. That's one way to look at the “[law of continued failure](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm)”.\n\nIf you had the kind of project where the fundamentals implied, say, a 15% chance of success, you’d then be on the right part of the logistic curve, and in _that_ case it could make a lot of sense to hunt for ways to bump that up to a 30% or 80% chance.\n\namber:  Look, I'm worried that it will really be very bad if Mr. Topaz reaches the market first with insecure drones. Like, I think that merchant drones could be very beneficial to countries without much existing market backbone, and if there's a grand failure—especially if some of the would-be customers have their money or items stolen—then it could poison the potential market for years. It will be terrible! Really, genuinely terrible!\n\ncoral:  Wow. That sure does sound like an unpleasant scenario to have wedged yourself into.\n\namber:  But what do we do now?\n\ncoral:  Damned if I know. I do suspect you're screwed so long as you can only win if somebody like Mr. Topaz creates a robust system. I guess you could try to have some other drone project come into existence, headed up by somebody that, say, Bruce Schneier assures everyone is unusually good at security-mindset thinking and hence can hire people like me and listen to all the harsh things we have to say. Though I have to admit, the part where you think it's drastically important that you beat an insecure system to market with a secure system—well, that sounds positively nightmarish. You're going to need a lot more resources than Mr. Topaz has, or some other kind of very major advantage. Security takes time.\n\namber:  Is it really that hard to add security to the drone system?\n\ncoral:  You keep talking about “adding” security. System robustness isn't the kind of property you can bolt onto software as an afterthought.\n\namber:  I guess I'm having trouble seeing why it's so much more expensive. Like, if somebody foolishly builds an OS that gives access to just anyone, you could instead put a password lock on it, using your clever system where the OS keeps the hashes of the passwords instead of the passwords. You just spend a couple of days rewriting all the services exposed to the Internet to ask for passwords before granting access. And then the OS has security on it! Right?\n\ncoral:  NO. Everything inside your system that is potentially subject to adverse selection in its probability of weird behavior is a liability! Everything exposed to an attacker, and everything those subsystems interact with, and everything _those_ parts interact with! You have to build _all_ of it robustly! If you want to build a secure OS you need a whole special project that is “building a secure operating system instead of an insecure operating system”. And you also need to restrict the scope of your ambitions, and not do everything you want to do, and obey other commandments that will feel like big unpleasant sacrifices to somebody who doesn't have the full security mindset. OpenBSD can’t do a tenth of what Ubuntu does. They can't afford to! It would be too large of an attack surface! They can't review that much code using the special process that they use to develop secure software! They can't hold that many assumptions in their minds!\n\namber:  Does that effort _have_ to take a significant amount of extra time? Are you sure it can't just be done in a couple more weeks if we hurry?\n\ncoral:  YES. Given that this is a novel project entering new territory, expect it to take _at least_ two years more time, or 50% more development time—whichever is less—compared to a security-incautious project that otherwise has identical tools, insights, people, and resources. And that is a very, very optimistic lower bound.\n\namber:  This story seems to be heading in a worrying direction.\n\ncoral:  Well, I'm sorry, but creating robust systems takes longer than creating non-robust systems even in cases where it would be really, extraordinarily bad if creating robust systems took longer than creating non-robust systems.\n\namber:  Couldn't it be the case that, like, projects which are implementing good security practices do everything so much cleaner and better that they can come to market faster than any insecure competitors could?\n\ncoral:  … I honestly have trouble seeing [why](http://www.readthesequences.com/MotivatedStoppingAndMotivatedContinuation) you’re [privileging that hypothesis](https://www.readthesequences.com/PrivilegingTheHypothesis) for consideration. Robustness involves assurance processes that take additional time. OpenBSD does not go through lines of code faster than Ubuntu.\n\nBut more importantly, if everyone has access to the same tools and insights and resources, then an unusually fast method of doing something cautiously can always be degenerated into an even faster method of doing the thing incautiously. There is not now, nor will there ever be, a programming language in which it is the least bit difficult to write bad programs. There is not now, nor will there ever be, a methodology that makes writing insecure software inherently slower than writing secure software. Any security professional who heard about your bright hopes would just laugh. Ask them too if you don't believe me.\n\namber:  But shouldn't engineers who aren't cautious just be unable to make software at all, because of ordinary bugs?\n\ncoral:  I am afraid that it is both possible, and _extremely_ common in practice, for people to fix all the bugs that are crashing their systems in ordinary testing today, using methodologies that are indeed adequate to fixing ordinary bugs that show up often enough to afflict a significant fraction of users, and then ship the product. They get everything working today, and they don't feel like they have the slack to delay any longer than that before shipping because the product is already behind schedule. They don't hire exceptional people to do ten times as much work in order to prevent the product from having holes that only show up under adverse optimization pressure, that somebody else finds first and that they learn about after it's too late.\n\nIt's not even the wrong decision, for products that aren't connected to the Internet, don't have enough users for one to go rogue, don't handle money, don't contain any valuable data, and don't do anything that could injure people if something goes wrong. If your software doesn't destroy anything important when it explodes, it's probably a better use of limited resources to plan on fixing bugs as they show up.\n\n… Of course, you need some amount of security mindset to realize which software _can_ in fact destroy the company if it silently corrupts data and nobody notices this until a month later. I don't suppose it's the case that your drones only carry a limited amount of the full corporate budget in cash over the course of a day, and you always have more than enough money to reimburse all the customers if all items in transit over a day were lost, taking into account that the drones might make many more purchases or sales than usual? And that the systems are generating internal paper receipts that are clearly shown to the customer and non-electronically reconciled once per day, thereby enabling you to notice a problem before it's too late?\n\namber:  Nope!\n\ncoral:  Then as you say, it would be better for the world if your company didn't exist and wasn't about to charge into this new territory and poison it with a spectacular screwup.\n\namber:  If I believed that… well, Mr. Topaz certainly isn't going to stop his project or let somebody else take over. It seems the logical implication of what you say you believe is that I should try to persuade the venture capitalists I know to launch a safer drone project with even more funding.\n\ncoral:  Uh, I'm sorry to be blunt about this, but I'm not sure _you_ have a high enough level of security mindset to identify an executive who's sufficiently better than you at it. Trying to get enough of a resource advantage to beat the insecure product to market is only half of your problem in launching a competing project. The other half of your problem is surpassing the prior rarity of people with truly deep security mindset, and getting somebody like that in charge and fully committed. Or at least get them in as a highly trusted, fully committed cofounder who isn't on a short budget of political capital. I'll say it again: an advisor appointed by VCs isn't nearly enough for a project like yours. Even if the advisor is a genuinely good security professional—\n\namber:  This all seems like an unreasonably difficult requirement! Can't you back down on it a little?\n\ncoral:  —the person in charge will probably try to bargain down reality, as represented by the unwelcome voice of the security professional, who won't have enough social capital to badger them into “unreasonable” measures. Which means you fail on full automatic.\n\namber:  … Then what am I to do?\n\ncoral:  I don't know, actually. But there's no point in launching another drone project with even more funding, if it just ends up with another Mr. Topaz put in charge. Which, by default, is exactly what your venture capitalist friends are going to do. Then you've just set an even higher competitive bar for anyone actually trying to be first to market with a secure solution, may God have mercy on their souls.\n\nBesides, if Mr. Topaz thinks he has a competitor breathing down his neck and rushes his product to market, his chance of creating a secure system could drop by a factor of ten and go all the way from 0.0% to 0.0%.\n\namber:  Surely my VC friends have faced this kind of problem before and know how to identify and hire executives who can do security well?\n\ncoral:  … If one of your VC friends is Paul Graham, then maybe yes. But in the average case, _NO_.\n\nIf average VCs always made sure that projects which needed security had a founder or cofounder with strong security mindset—if they had the _ability_ to do that _even in cases where they decided they wanted to_—the Internet would again look like a very different place. By default, your VC friends will be fooled by somebody who looks very sober and talks a lot about how terribly concerned he is with cybersecurity and how the system is going to be ultra-secure and reject over nine thousand common passwords, including the thirty-six passwords listed on this slide here, and the VCs will ooh and ah over it, especially as one of them realizes that their own password is on the slide. _That_ project leader is absolutely not going to want to hear from me—even less so than Mr. Topaz. To him, I'm a political threat who might damage his line of patter to the VCs.\n\namber:  I have trouble believing all these smart people are really that stupid.\n\ncoral:  You're compressing your innate sense of social status and your estimated level of how good particular groups are at this particular ability into a single dimension. That is not a good idea.\n\namber:  I'm not saying that I think everyone with high status already knows the deep security skill. I'm just having trouble believing that they can't learn it quickly once told, or could be stuck not being able to identify good advisors who have it. That would mean they couldn't know something you know, something that seems important, and that just… feels _off_ to me, somehow. Like, there are all these successful and important people out there, and you’re saying [you’re _better_ than them](https://www.lesserwrong.com/sequences/oLGCcbnvabyibnG9d), even with all their influence, their skills, their resources—\n\ncoral:  Look, you don't have to take my word for it. Think of all the websites you've been on, with snazzy-looking design, maybe with millions of dollars in sales passing through them, that want your password to be a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. In other words, they want you to enter “Password1!” instead of “correct horse battery staple”. Every one of those websites is doing a thing that looks humorously silly to someone with a full security mindset or even just somebody who regularly reads [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/936/). It says that the security system was set up by somebody who didn't know what they were doing and was blindly imitating impressive-looking mistakes they saw elsewhere.\n\nDo you think that makes a good impression on their customers? That's right, it does! Because the customers don't know any better. Do you think that login system makes a good impression on the company's investors, including professional VCs and probably some angels with their own startup experience? That's right, it does! Because the VCs don't know any better, and even the angel doesn't know any better, and they don't realize they're missing a vital skill, and they aren't consulting anyone who knows more. An innocent is _impressed_ if a website requires a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers _and_ punctuation. They think the people running the website must really care to impose a security measure that unusual and inconvenient. The people running the website think that's what they're doing too.\n\nPeople with deep security mindset are both rare and rarely _appreciated_. You can see just from the login system that none of the VCs and none of the C-level executives at that startup thought they needed to consult a real professional, or managed to find a real professional rather than an empty suit if they went consulting. There was, visibly, nobody in the neighboring system with the combined knowledge and status to walk over to the CEO and say, “Your login system is embarrassing and you need to hire a real security professional.” Or if anybody did say that to the CEO, the CEO was offended and shot the messenger for not phrasing it ever-so-politely enough, or the CTO saw the outsider as a political threat and bad-mouthed them out of the game.\n\nYour wishful should-universe hypothesis that people who can touch the full security mindset are more common than that within the venture capital and angel investing ecosystem is just flat wrong. Ordinary paranoia directed at widely-known adversarial cases is dense enough within the larger ecosystem to exert widespread social influence, albeit still comically absent in many individuals and regions. People with the full security mindset are too rare to have the same level of presence. That's the _easily visible_ truth. You can _see_ the login systems that want a punctuation mark in your password. You are not hallucinating them.\n\namber:  If that's all true, then I just don't see how I can win. Maybe I should just condition on everything you say being false, since, if it's true, my winning seems unlikely—in which case all victories on my part would come in worlds with other background assumptions.\n\ncoral:  … is that something you say often?\n\namber:  Well, I say it whenever my victory starts to seem sufficiently unlikely.\n\ncoral:  Goodness. I could maybe, _maybe_ see somebody saying that once over the course of their entire lifetime, for a single unlikely conditional, but doing it more than once is sheer madness. I'd expect the unlikely conditionals to build up very fast and drop the probability of your mental world to effectively zero. It's tempting, but it's usually a bad idea to slip sideways into your own private [hallucinatory universe](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10154981483669228) when you feel you're under emotional pressure. I tend to believe that no matter what the difficulties, we are most likely to come up with good plans when we are mentally living in reality as opposed to somewhere else. If things seem difficult, we must face the difficulty squarely to succeed, to come up with some solution that faces down how bad the situation really is, rather than deciding to condition on things not being difficult because then it's too hard.\n\namber:  Can you at least _try_ talking to Mr. Topaz and advise him how to make things be secure?\n\ncoral:  Sure. Trying things is easy, and I’m a character in a dialogue, so my opportunity costs are low. I'm sure Mr. Topaz is trying to build secure merchant drones, too. It's succeeding at things that is the hard part.\n\namber:  Great, I'll see if I can get Mr. Topaz to talk to you. But do please be polite! If you think he's doing something wrong, try to point it out more gently than the way you've talked to me. I think I have enough political capital to get you in the door, but that won't last if you're rude.\n\ncoral:  You know, back in mainstream computer security, when you propose a new way of securing a system, it's considered traditional and wise for everyone to gather around and try to come up with reasons why your idea might not work. It's understood that no matter how smart you are, most seemingly bright ideas turn out to be flawed, and that you shouldn't be touchy about people trying to shoot them down. Does Mr. Topaz have no acquaintance at all with the practices in computer security? A lot of programmers do.\n\namber:  I think he'd say he respects computer security as its own field, but he doesn't believe that building secure operating systems is the same problem as building merchant drones.\n\ncoral:  And if I suggested that this case might be similar to the problem of building a secure operating system, and that this case creates a similar need for more effortful and cautious development, requiring both (a) additional development time and (b) a special need for caution supplied by people with unusual mindsets above and beyond ordinary paranoia, who have an unusual skill that identifies shaky assumptions in a safety story before an ordinary paranoid would judge a fire as being urgent enough to need putting out, who can remedy the problem using deeper solutions than an ordinary paranoid would generate as parries against imagined attacks?\n\nIf I suggested, indeed, that this scenario might hold generally wherever we demand robustness of a complex system that is being subjected to strong external or internal optimization pressures? Pressures that strongly promote the probabilities of particular states of affairs via optimization that searches across a large and complex state space? Pressures which therefore in turn subject other subparts of the system to selection for weird states and previously unenvisioned execution paths? Especially if some of these pressures may be in some sense creative and find states of the system or environment that surprise us or violate our surface generalizations?\n\namber:  I think he'd probably think you were trying to look smart by using overly abstract language at him. Or he'd reply that he didn't see why this took any more caution than he was already using just by testing the drones to make sure they didn't crash or give out too much money.\n\ncoral:  I see.\n\namber:  So, shall we be off?\n\ncoral:  Of course! No problem! I'll just go meet with Mr. Topaz and use verbal persuasion to turn him into Bruce Schneier.\n\namber:  That's the spirit!\n\ncoral:  God, how I wish I lived in the territory that corresponds to your map.\n\namber:  Hey, come on. Is it seriously _that_ hard to bestow exceptionally rare mental skills on people by talking at them? I agree it's a bad sign that Mr. Topaz shows no sign of wanting to acquire those skills, and doesn't think we have enough relative status to continue listening if we say something he doesn't want to hear. But that just means we have to phrase our advice cleverly so that he _will_ want to hear it!\n\ncoral:  I suppose you could modify your message into something Mr. Topaz doesn't find so unpleasant to hear. Something that sounds related to the topic of drone security, but which doesn't cost him much, and of course does not actually cause his drones to end up secure because that would be all unpleasant and expensive. You could slip a little sideways in reality, and convince yourself that you've gotten Mr. Topaz to ally with you, because he sounds agreeable now. Your instinctive desire for the high-status monkey to be on your political side will feel like its problem has been solved. You can substitute the feeling of having solved that problem for the unpleasant sense of not having secured the actual drones; you can tell yourself that the bigger monkey will take care of everything now that he seems to be on your pleasantly-modified political side. And so you will be happy. Until the merchant drones hit the market, of course, but that unpleasant experience should be brief.\n\namber:  Come on, we can do this! You've just got to think positively!\n\ncoral:  … Well, if nothing else, this should be an interesting experience. I've never tried to do anything quite this doomed before."

      "markdown": "Paul Christiano has devised [**a new fundamental approach**](http://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Christiano-et-al-Naturalistic-reflection-early-draft.pdf) to the \"[Löb Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwriJqBZyoM)\" wherein [Löb's Theorem](/lw/t6/the_cartoon_guide_to_l%C3%B6bs_theorem/) seems to pose an obstacle to AIs building successor AIs, or adopting successor versions of their own code, that trust the same amount of mathematics as the original.  (I am currently writing up a more thorough description of the _question_ this preliminary technical report is working on answering.  For now the main online description is in a [quick Summit talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwriJqBZyoM) I gave.  See also Benja Fallenstein's description of the problem in the course of presenting a [different angle of attack](/lw/e4e/an_angle_of_attack_on_open_problem_1/).  Roughly the problem is that mathematical systems can only prove the soundness of, aka 'trust', weaker mathematical systems.  If you try to write out an exact description of how AIs would build their successors or successor versions of their code in the most obvious way, it looks like the mathematical strength of the proof system would tend to be stepped down each time, which is undesirable.)\n\nPaul Christiano's approach is inspired by the idea that whereof one cannot prove or disprove, thereof one must assign probabilities: and that although no mathematical system can contain its own _truth_ predicate, a mathematical system might be able to contain a reflectively consistent _probability_ predicate.  In particular, it looks like we can have:\n\n∀a, b:  (a < P(φ) < b)          ⇒  P(a < P('φ') < b) = 1  \n∀a, b:  P(a ≤ P('φ') ≤ b) > 0  ⇒  a ≤ P(φ) ≤ b\n\nSuppose I present you with the human and probabilistic version of a Gödel sentence, the [Whitely sentence](http://books.google.com/books?id=cmX8yyBfP74C&pg=PA317&lpg=PA317&dq=whitely+lucas+cannot+consistently&source=bl&ots=68tuximFfI&sig=GdZro1wy6g_KzO-PXInGTKFrU7Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7-FMUb61LojRiAK9hIGQDw&ved=0CGoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=whitely%20lucas%20cannot%20consistently&f=false) \"You assign this statement a probability less than 30%.\"  If you disbelieve this statement, it is true.  If you believe it, it is false.  If you assign 30% probability to it, it is false.  If you assign 29% probability to it, it is true.\n\nPaul's approach resolves this problem by restricting your belief about your own probability assignment to within epsilon of 30% for any epsilon.  So Paul's approach replies, \"Well, I assign _almost_ exactly 30% probability to that statement - maybe a little more, maybe a little less - in fact I think there's about a 30% chance that I'm a tiny bit under 0.3 probability and a 70% chance that I'm a tiny bit over 0.3 probability.\"  A standard fixed-point theorem then implies that a consistent assignment like this should exist.  If asked if the probability is over 0.2999 or under 0.30001 you will reply with a definite yes.\n\nWe haven't yet worked out a walkthrough showing if/how this solves the Löb obstacle to self-modification, and the probabilistic theory itself is nonconstructive (we've shown that something like this should exist, but not how to compute it).  Even so, a possible fundamental triumph over Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of truth and a number of standard Gödelian limitations is important news as math _qua_ math, though work here is still in very preliminary stages.  There are even whispers of unrestricted comprehension in a probabilistic version of set theory with ∀φ: ∃S: P(x ∈ S) = P(φ(x)), though this part is not in the preliminary report and is at even earlier stages and could easily not work out at all.\n\nIt seems important to remark on how this result was developed:  Paul Christiano showed up with the idea (of consistent probabilistic reflection via a fixed-point theorem) to a week-long \"math squad\" (aka MIRI Workshop) with Marcello Herreshoff, Mihaly Barasz, and myself; then we all spent the next week proving that version after version of Paul's idea couldn't work or wouldn't yield self-modifying AI; until finally, a day after the workshop was supposed to end, it produced something that looked like it might work.  If we hadn't been trying to _solve_ this problem (with hope stemming from how it seemed like the sort of thing a reflective rational agent ought to be able to do somehow), this would be just another batch of impossibility results in the math literature.  I remark on this because it may help demonstrate that Friendly AI is a productive approach to math _qua _math, which may aid some mathematician in becoming interested.\n\nI further note that this does not mean the Löbian obstacle is resolved and no further work is required.  Before we can conclude that we need a computably specified version of the theory plus a walkthrough for a self-modifying agent using it.\n\nSee also the [blog post](http://intelligence.org/2013/03/22/early-draft-of-naturalistic-reflection-paper/) on the MIRI site (and subscribe to MIRI's newsletter [here](http://intelligence.org/) to keep abreast of research updates).\n\nThis LW post is the preferred place for feedback on the [paper](http://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Christiano-et-al-Naturalistic-reflection-early-draft.pdf).\n\nEDIT:  But see discussion on a Google+ post by John Baez [here](https://plus.google.com/117663015413546257905/posts/jJModdTJ2R3?hl=en).  Also see [here](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Comment_formatting#Using_LaTeX_to_render_mathematics) for how to display math LaTeX in comments."

      "markdown": "Growing up, as a kid, I was always told that every sapient life is precious, everything that thinks and knows itself -\n\nYes, this *is* a tale about lies-told-to-children.  You'll probably figure it out yourself before too long.  For now, just listen.\n\nWhere was I?  Right.  As children, we were always told that every sapient life is precious.  It was told to us by the teachers, and shown to us in children's television - though I saw less children's television than most children in our age cohort - children's TV was censored where I grew up, though, of course, I didn't find that out until much later -\n\nI see you're starting to guess under what sort of circumstances I grew up.  Go ahead, write down the prediction if you want.  Maybe you already see where this entire thing is headed.  But you asked me for a story about the lies I was told as a child, and that's what you're getting.  It's not my fault, if a lot of stories like that are predictable; people who lie to children have other things to optimize for than unpredictability.\n\nSo where was I?  Right.  I grew up in a remote village of about three thousand people, the sort that's more hills than houses.  Charming travel-pathways that cut through forests.  Not everyone knows everyone, but you sure know somebody who knows anybody.\n\nChildren's television in my region was censored, though of course they didn't tell us that as children.  But the children's television that we saw had aliens and monsters and creatures of fantasy, with four legs or fourteen legs, three faces or no face at all, and all of them were treated by the television show as having lives that meant something.  Sometimes in the children's show there were alien monsters who only thought their own kind of life was valuable, and then maybe you couldn't trade with them as friends.  Maybe they'd already lied to you once and you couldn't trust them enough to bargain with them, maybe you couldn't talk to them at all.  But their lives still had meaning to the story's human protagonists, even some aliens whose lives had no meaning to themselves.  You didn't cause them pain if there was any way to avoid it; you didn't kill them unless their biology was sufficiently similar to human that you were confident in your ability to cryopreserve them afterwards.\n\nThe shows never spelled it out, never said, 'And this is because of a universal rule in every case that sapient life has value.'  Our teachers said that explicitly, though.\n\nAnd they treated every one of us children, too, as if our lives had meaning.\n\nExcept the children with the red hair; those dirty reds.\n\nYou're nodding along with a knowing look, I see.  Was it what you predicted?  Not exactly, maybe, but rough ballpark?  I suppose I'll find out when we open your prediction afterwards.\n\nThe red-haired children hardly needed the red hair, as their targeting-mark; they looked different from the rest of us in other ways too.  When I was old enough to first ask, I was told that they were the children's children of people who'd been exiled from a faraway city for committing terrible crimes there, who'd been given sanctuary by the grace and mercy of our own benevolent kind.  The red-haired children tended bigger than the rest of us, with more adult facial structures, to the point where you could've maybe mistaken them for very small adults in disguise.  The red-haired adults, what few of them we ever saw, were correspondingly huge and muscular.  You could see, in retrospect - if you were actually trying to think at all, which we weren't really - how somebody might have felt threatened by such big muscular people, even while graciously granting them sanctuary.\n\nThere weren't many of the red-haired children being educated alongside us; a handful, four or six.  I can't recall how many by counting names, because they kept to themselves and did not try to be friends with the rest of us.\n\nThey were slower than the rest of us in class to answer.  On the rare occasions a teacher called on them, they'd often get the question wrong.  We were kids, young kids, so of course we didn't ask ourselves anything like \"Is this in fact an intrinsic deficit of intelligence or is it a self-fulfilling prophecy about who gets more effort from the teachers?\" or come up with any experiments to test that one way or another.  We just wordlessly thought that red-haired kids were stupider; and that this too was a universal rule just like gravity.\n\nWe did not, in fact, treat our red-headed fellow kids all that well.  We were of an age where kids take their cues from adults without carefully rethinking everything they're seeing.  We noticed how the older kids treated red-haired kids, we noticed how teachers treated red-haired kids, we noticed the huge red-headed adults who were silently sweeping the hallways and not doing any intellectual labor.  We noticed how the adult reds got casually shoved aside by other adults or even non-red-headed older kids, and how the red-headed adults just silently took that.\n\nThere were names to call them, 'dirty reds', worse things than that, scatological profanities to giggle over amongst ourselves.\n\nNow and then you'd see a Security Officer come by and ask some reds some questions.  One time Security took one of the janitors away, and then after that, nobody ever saw him again.  I think one of the kids did ask, in class, what happened to that guy, and the teacher shut her right down and said that any questions about dirty reds or for that matter Security were things best asked in private if you asked at all.\n\nAnd meanwhile the television shows, those that we got to watch, went right on teaching the lesson that all sapient life is precious, with no exceptions for fourteen legs or not having a face.\n\nEventually, of course, it started coming to a point, and then it did come to a point.\n\nIt started to come to a point, at the point where a red-haired kid was called on in class and answered a question wrong, and the teacher asked if his parents were too busy stealing other people's books to teach him how to read.  The red-haired kid didn't say anything back, but I flinched, visibly.\n\nIt came to the point, two days after that, when I was walking home from class, and I heard a groan from off the pathway home, what sounded like a moan of pain.\n\nI left the pathway and ran around a hill to find one of those dirty reds hiding behind it, with blood all over his left pants-leg.\n\nHe asked me not to get an adult.\n\nHe said that he was hiding from Security.\n\nHe asked me to help him walk, help him get away.\n\nIt didn't feel real.  It felt like I was inside one of the children's television shows.\n\nOf course, in children's television shows, they always show the heroes reminding themselves that things are real and that they've got to do what's right, because it's real, so I knew that I needed to remember that this was real because that's what you do when you're inside a television show.\n\nI think I was probably very scared, though I don't remember noticing myself being scared.\n\nI asked him what he'd done to get Security looking for him.\n\nHe said that he had, a few days ago, said something about red-haired people deserving better treatment than they currently got, around a non-red-haired person he'd thought, hoped, was a friend.\n\nI gave him a hand so he could stand up, on the leg that wasn't covered with blood, and then he leaned on me and we hopped away through the hills until we got to where a red-haired woman - you saw fewer of those - whispered a thank-you to me and took him away with herself.\n\nI ran back to the pathway and ran home, though I was still late, of course.  My dad asked me where I'd been and I said I'd seen a funny-looking butterfly and run off to chase it.  I remember believing, even then, that he knew I was lying, but dad didn't ask me any more questions, and I didn't tell him anything.\n\nAbout an hour later, Security knocked on our door and asked everyone if they'd seen a red-haired person who looked like - and of course the picture was of the man I'd helped to get away.\n\nI said no, I hadn't seen him.  But because I was a kid and kids that age aren't taught theory-of-deception, I asked what the man had done and if he was considered dangerous.  And I didn't think, until too late, about whether that was something I was much more likely to ask if -\n\nThe Security officer asked me if I maybe wanted to change my mind about having seen the fugitive.\n\nI gave him my best surprised look and said no.\n\nThe Security officer noted that Security officers get special training in reading emotions, and I seemed pretty frightened to him.\n\nI said yes, I was, because the Security officer was suggesting that I was lying and that was scary.\n\nThe Security officer said he knew perfectly well, at this point, that I was lying.  But I wouldn't end up in trouble if I showed him where the fugitive went and identified anyone else he was with.\n\nI said that he didn't know what he was talking about.\n\nThe Security officer gave me a sort of stern look and said that he'd detected another lie, and did I *really* want to get in trouble for some dirty red.\n\nI told him that I wasn't stupid and I knew he was bluffing, to try to trick me, because he suspected me, even though I hadn't done it.\n\nHe took a photo out of his pocket and showed it to me.\n\nIt was me helping the red-haired man walk on his one good leg.\n\n*Why*, said the Security.  He just looked sad, now.  Why *had* I done it?  Why was a dirty red worth it?\n\nAnd I remember, by *that* point, that I'd noticed I was scared, and I think I *was* trying to get out of it - by proving that I was, in the end, obeying adult authority - when I said that we'd all been told in class that every sapient life is precious, everything that thinks and knows itself, that was the rule we'd been given, and nobody had reasonably *argued* at any point that there was an exception for people with red hair, and *also* we'd all been told that hurting people is wrong and you shouldn't let social conformity push you into it.\n\nThe rest of it went the way you'd expect.\n\nThe Security officer smiled.\n\nMy parents rushed in and hugged me and told me I'd been *so* brave and *so* good and scored in what would've been the upper 5th percentile twenty years ago for the age where I started to object and not go along with it anymore; and explained about Civilization needing to test *some* kids now and then, to find out how well we were doing environment-wise and heredity-wise on people's kindness and resistance to conformity-pushed cruelty; and test against an earlier-reported bug where general rules about fair and okay treatment of people would somehow end up not being applied to some subgroup; and our little village was settling an important conditional prediction market from twenty years earlier, that had millions of labor-hours wagered on it; and that children growing up to be good people was a vital figure-of-merit for all of Civilization and lots of big policy decisions turned around it, which was why it had been worth specializing our village to do Science about that, and they hoped I understood all that and wouldn't tell the other children right away.  There wasn't actually any such thing as Security, and if there ever *was* it would mean that it was time to overthrow the government immediately.\n\nI nodded along in a wise, understanding, and rather numb fashion.  I think the main thing I said, at the end, was that I'd better be getting paid for this, and they all laughed and said of course I was, lots of money, at least as much as my parents were getting, because children are sapient beings too.\n\nSo that's *my *story about the-lies-we-tell-to-children.  And the part that I value now the most, even more than the money I got then and when I was older, even more than knowing that I was good and brave in the only sort of real test that most people in Civilization ever get, is that I approximately always win any Lies-Told-To-Children storytelling night."

      "markdown": "*tl;dr: The LessWrong team is re-organizing as* [*Lightcone Infrastructure*](http://www.lightconeinfrastructure.com/)*. LessWrong is one of several projects we are working on to ensure the future of humanity goes well. We are looking to hire software engineers as well as generalist entrepreneurs in Berkeley who are excited to build infrastructure to ensure a good future.*\n\nI founded the LessWrong 2.0 team in 2017, with the goal of reviving LessWrong.com and reinvigorating the intellectual culture of the rationality community. I believed the community had great potential for affecting the long term future, but that the failing website was a key bottleneck to community health and growth.\n\nFour years later, the website still seems very important. But when I step back and ask “what are the key bottlenecks for improving the longterm future?”, just ensuring the website is going well no longer seems sufficient.\n\nFor the past year, I’ve been re-organizing the LessWrong team into something with a larger scope. As I’ve learned from talking to over a thousand of you over the last 4 years, for most of you the rationality community is much larger than just this website, and your contributions to the future of humanity more frequently than not route through many disparate parts of our sprawling diaspora. Many more of those parts deserve attention and optimization than just LessWrong, and we seem to be the best positioned organization to make sure that happens.\n\nI want to make sure that that whole ecosystem is successfully steering humanity towards safer and better futures, and more and more this has meant working on projects that weren't directly related to LessWrong.com: \n\n*   A bit over a year ago we started building grant-making software for Jaan Tallinn and the Survival and Flourishing Fund, helping distribute over 30 million dollars to projects that I think have the potential to have a substantial effect on ensuring a flourishing future for humanity.\n*   We helped run dozens of online meetups and events during the pandemic, and hundreds of in-person events for both this year and 2019s ACX Meetups everywhere\n*   We helped build and run the EA Forum and the AI Alignment Forum,\n*   We recently ran a 5-day retreat for 60-70 people whose work we think is highly impactful in reducing the likelihood of humanity's extinction,\n*   We opened an in-person office space in the Bay Area for organizations that are working towards improving the long-term future of humanity.\n\nAs our projects outside of the LessWrong.com website multiplied, our name became more and more confusing when trying to explain to people what we were about. \n\nThis confusion reached a new peak when we started having a team that we were internally calling the \"LessWrong team\", which was responsible for running the website, distinct from all of our other projects, and which soon after caused me to utter the following sentence at one of our team meetings: \n\n> LessWrong really needs to figure out what the LessWrong team should set as a top priority for LessWrong\n\nAs one can imagine, the reaction from the rest of the team was confusion and laughter and at that point I knew we had to change our name and clarify our organizational mission. \n\nSo, after doing many rounds of coming up with names, asking many of our colleagues and friends (including GPT-3) for suggestions, we finally decided on:\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/19f81bb3a671af655ea5d7ac08f1916c211ec158b55f78c7.png)\n\nI like the light cone as a symbol, because it represents the massive scale of opportunity that humanity is presented with. If things go right, we can shape almost the full light cone of humanity to be full of flourishing life. Billions of galaxies, billions of light years across, for some 10^36 (or so) years until the heat death of the universe. \n\nSeparately, I am excited about where Lightcone Infrastructure is headed as an organization. I really enjoy working with the team, and I feel like there is a ton of low-hanging fruit in doing more end-to-end community optimization. This community of rationalists, effective altruists and longtermists has achieved an enormous amount, both in scale of impact, and in coming to a deeper understanding about the world, and I think our work in reviving LessWrong and our other infrastructure projects have already made a big difference in that success.\n\nLessWrong will have a dedicated team within Lightcone Infrastructure. Ruby will be taking the lead on that, and he already has a number of great plans for the website that I expect he will tell you about in the near future. The current team and structure is: \n\n*   [Oliver Habryka](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/habryka4) (CEO)\n*   Campus team:\n    *   [Jacob Lagerros](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jacobjacob)\n    *   [Ben Pace](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benito)\n    *   [Raymond Arnold](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/raemon)\n*   Site team:\n    *   [Ruben Bloom (Ruby)](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/ruby)\n\n[Jim Babcock](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jimrandomh) is also paid by us as an independent Open Source contributor to the LessWrong website, and helps a lot with development. I also still fix bugs, answer support requests and write code, though I primarily spend my time on management these days.\n\nIf you want to work with us on these projects, we are hiring for three positions: \n\n*   A software engineer for LessWrong.com to assist with maintenance and expansion of the Rationalist community's online publishing hub ([more info](https://www.lightconeinfrastructure.com/lesswrong-software.html))\n*   A generalist to join our new campus team to build a thriving in-person rationality and longtermism community in the Bay Area ([more info](https://www.lightconeinfrastructure.com/campus-generalist.html))\n*   A software engineer and product manager to be in charge of the \"S-Process\" application, a suite of custom software for grantmaking that we develop for Jaan Tallinn and the Survival and Flourishing Fund ([more info](https://www.lightconeinfrastructure.com/s-process-developer.html))\n\nWe are also open to hiring people who don't fit into any of these positions, so err on the side of applying if you want to work with us. If you have thoughts on how to build a successful rationality and longtermism community, want to build a 1000-person strong campus, or have a pitch for a different infrastructure project we should run, reach out to us, and we would be excited to talk to you about working here.\n\nOur current salary policy is to pay rates competitive with industry salary minus 30%. Given prevailing salary levels in the Bay Area for the kind of skill level we are looking at, we expect salaries to start at $150k/year plus healthcare (but we would be open to paying $315k for someone who would make $450k in industry). We also provide a generous relocation package if you aren't currently located in the Bay Area.\n\nApply here: [https://airtable.com/shrdqS6JXok99f6EX](https://airtable.com/shrdqS6JXok99f6EX)"

Notions of fairness should not directly say \"everyone should have the same expected utility\". Utilitarian ethics cannot directly maximize the sum of everyone's utility. Both of these operations should be thought of as a type error.</p><h1 id=\"Some_non_obvious_consequences_\">Some non-obvious consequences.</h1><p>The game-theory term \"zero sum\" is a misnomer. You shouldn't directly think about the sum of the utilities.</p><p>In mechanism design, <i>exchangeable utility</i> is a useful assumption which is often needed in order to get nice results. The idea is that agents can give utils to each other, perhaps to compensate for unfair outcomes. This is <i>kind of</i> like assuming there's money which can be exchanged between agents. However, the non-comparability of utility should make this seem <i>really weird</i>. (There are also other disanalogies with money; for example, utility is closer to logarithmic in money, not linear.)</p><p>This could (should?) also make you suspicious of talk of \"average utilitarianism\" and \"total utilitarianism\". However, beware: only one kind of \"utilitarianism\" holds that the term \"utility\" in decision theory means the same thing as \"utility\" in ethics: namely, preference utilitarianism. Other kinds of utilitarianism can distinguish between these two types of utility. (For example, one can be a hedonic utilitarian without thinking that what everyone wants is happiness, if one isn't a preference utilitarian.)</p><p>Similarly, for preference utilitarians, talk of <i>utility monsters</i> becomes questionable. A utility monster is, supposedly, someone who gets much more utility out of resources than everyone else. For a hedonic utilitarian, it would be someone who experiences much deeper sadness and much higher heights of happiness. This person supposedly merits more resources than other people.</p><p>For a preference utilitarian, incomparability of utility means we can't simply posit such a utility monster. It's meaningless <i>a priori</i> to say that one person simply has much stronger preferences than another (in the utility function sense).</p><p>All that being said, we <i>can</i> actually compare utilities, sum them, exchange utility between agents, define utility monsters, and so on. We just need <i>more information.</i></p><h1 id=\"Comparing_utilities_\">Comparing utilities.</h1><p>The incomparability of utility functions <i><strong>doesn't mean</strong></i> we can't trade off between the utilities of different people.</p><p>I've heard the non-comparability of utility functions summarized as the thesis that we can't say anything meaningful about the relative value of one person's suffering vs another person's convenience. Not so! Rather, the point is just that <i>we need more assumptions in order to say anything. </i>The utility functions alone aren't enough.</p><h2 id=\"Pareto_Optimality__The_Minimal_Standard\">Pareto-Optimality: The Minimal Standard</h2><p>Comparing utility functions suggests putting them all onto one scale, such that we can trade off between them -- \"this dollar does more good for Alice than it does for Bob\". We formalize this by imagining that we have to decide policy for the whole group of people we're considering (e.g., the whole world). We consider a <i>social choice function</i> which would make those decisions on behalf of everyone. Supposing it is VNM rational, its decisions must be comprehensible in terms of a utility function, too. So the problem reduces to combining a bunch of individual utility functions, to get one big one.</p><p>So, how do we go about combining the preferences of many agents into one?</p><p>The first and most important concept is the <i><strong>pareto improvement:</strong> our social choice function should endorse changes which benefit someone and harm no one. </i>An option which allows no such improvements is said to be <i><strong>Pareto-optimal.</strong></i></p><p>We might also want to consider <i><strong>strict Pareto improvements:</strong> a change which benefits everyone. </i>(An option which allows no strict Pareto improvements is <i><strong>weakly Pareto-optimal.</strong></i>) Strict Pareto improvements can be more relevant <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037554e/distributed-cooperation?commentId=5bd75cc58225bf0670375550\">in a bargaining context</a>, where you need to give everyone something in order to get them on board with a proposal -- otherwise they may judge the improvement as unfairly favoring others. However, in a bargaining context, individuals may refuse even a strict Pareto improvement <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z2YwmzuT7nWx62Kfh/cooperating-with-agents-with-different-ideas-of-fairness\">due to fairness considerations</a>.</p><p>In either case, a version of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sZuw6SGfmZHvcAAEP/complete-class-consequentialist-foundations#Utilitarianism\">Harsanyi's utilitarianism Theorem</a> implies that the utility of our social choice function <i>can be understood as some linear combination of the individual utility functions.</i></p><p>So, pareto-optimal social choice functions can always be understood by:</p><ol><li>Choosing a scale for everyone's utility function -- IE, set the multiplicative constant. (If the social choice function is only weakly Pareto optimal, some of the multiplicative constants might turn out to be zero, totally cancelling out someone's involvement. Otherwise, they can all be positive.)</li><li>Adding all of them together.</li></ol><p>(Note that the <i>additive constant</i> doesn't matter -- shifting a person's utility function up or down doesn't change what decisions will be endorsed by the sum. However, it <i><strong>will</strong></i> matter for some other ways to combine utility functions.)</p><p>This is nice, because we can always combine everything linearly!

(Note that <i>variance</i> <i>of utility</i> is only well-defined under some assumption about <i>probability of outcome.</i>) That's pretty good. It's probably the best we can get, in terms of strategy-proofness of voting. Will MacAskill also argues for variance normalization in the context of normative uncertainty (<a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/34857095/Normative_Uncertainty__Complete.pdf?1411561048=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DNormative_Uncertainty.pdf&amp;Expires=1599854518&amp;Signature=Z-cD7ds~K1cZc-GlXyV~eppzxbVKlwJCIkz6AQIHUg4jOgQlMAcgi3X1cCX~Z~FSvXKAYEwTyqehuuxCkMA2hxguilao82uaF8cH7sEZxczg243o2S5k4sZ7-YeIp5cJ2U-UAsecA-JbROuHU9AkUnlR02-rL4q-JlAlCOBBP5CDjJC6aocEM1HEyL0bHxFXf7Wg~B4Jyf8KSlvdnuAbm7IFn~lbmrBLb6OQG5~VbGAz8rfH2AuZlbZOpdVoID~MgPtIZ9rF1kMAcrUAhS93D15BPd8XNDRAOtMKMvSs~5xh5Ok-7dQhTFhqXkk~YE4S23VoKGGwqGZp4yl9X6WnTQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\"><i>Normative Uncertainty, </i>Will MacAskill, 2014</a>).</p><p>Intuitively, variance normalization directly addresses the issue we encountered with range normalization: an individual attempts to make their preferences \"loud\" by extremizing everything to 0 or 1. This increases variance, so, is directly punished by variance normalization.</p><p>However, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jameson-quinn\">Jameson Quinn</a>, LessWrong's resident voting theory expert, has warned me rather strongly about variance normalization.</p><ol><li>The assumption of shared beliefs about election outcomes is far from true in practice. Jameson Quinn tells me that, in fact, the strategic voting incentivized by quadratic voting is <i>particularly bad</i> amongst normalization techniques.</li><li>Strategy-proofness isn't, after all, the final arbiter of the quality of a voting method. The final arbiter should be something like the utilitarian quality of an election's outcome. This question gets a bit weird and recursive in the current context, where I'm using elections as an analogy to ask how we should define utilitarian outcomes. But the point still, to some extent, stands.</li></ol><p>I didn't understand the full justification behind his point, but I came away thinking that range normalization was probably better in practice. After all, it reduces to approval voting, which is actually a pretty good form of voting. But if you want to do the best we can with the state of voting theory, Jameson Quinn suggested 3-2-1 voting. (I don't think 3-2-1 voting gives us any nice theory about how to combine utility functions, though, so it isn't so useful for our purposes.)</p><p><strong>Open Question: </strong><i>Is there a variant of variance normalization which takes differing beliefs into account, to achieve strategy-proofness (IE honest reporting of utility)?</i></p><p>Anyway, so much for normalization techniques. These techniques ignore the broader context. They attempt to be fair and even-handed <i>in the way we choose the multiplicative and additive constants.</i> But we could also explicitly try to be fair and even-handed <i>in the way we choose between Pareto-optimal outcomes</i>, as with this next technique.</p><h2 id=\"Nash_Bargaining_Solution\">Nash Bargaining Solution</h2><p>It's important to remember that the Nash bargaining solution is a solution <i>to the Nash bargaining problem</i>, which isn't quite our problem here. But I'm going to gloss over that. Just imagine that we're setting the social choice function through a massive negotiation, so that we can apply bargaining theory.</p><p>Nash offers a very simple solution, which I'll get to in a minute. But first, a few words on how this solution is derived. Nash provides two seperate justifications for his solution. The first is a game-theoretic derivation of the solution as an especially robust Nash equilibrium. I won't detail that here; I quite recommend <a href=\"http://www.rasmusen.org/GI/reader/12a.nash.bargaining.1950.pdf\">his original paper</a> (<i>The Bargaining Problem, </i>1950); but, just keep in mind that there is at least some reason to expect selfishly rational agents to hit upon this particular solution. The second, unrelated justification is an axiomatic one:</p><ol><li><i>Invariance to equivalent utility functions. </i>This is the same motivation I gave when discussing normalization.</li><li><i>Pareto optimality.</i> We've already discussed this as well.</li><li><i>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA).</i> This says that we shouldn't change the outcome of bargaining by removing options which won't ultimately get chosen anyway. This isn't even technically one of the VNM axioms, but it <i>essentially </i>is -- the VNM axioms are posed for binary preferences (a &gt; b). IIA is the assumption we need to break down multi-choice preferences to binary choices. We can justify IIA with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037539a/generalizing-foundations-of-decision-theory-ii\">a kind of money pump</a>.</li><li><i>Symmetry.</i> This says that the outcome doesn't depend on the order of the bargainers; we don't prefer Player 1 in case of a tie, or anything like that.</li></ol><p>Nash proved that <i>the only way to meet these four criteria</i> is to maximize the <strong>product</strong> of gains from cooperation.

If you remove one of the possible outcomes, the normalization may change. This makes the social choice function display inconsistent preferences across different scenarios. (But how bad is that, really?)</p><p>As for why we can get away with maximizing the product, rather than the sum:</p><p>The Pareto-optimality of Nash's approach guarantees that it <i>can be seen</i> as maximizing a linear function of the individual utilities. So Harsanyi's theorem is still satisfied. However, Nash's solution points to a very <i>specific</i> outcome, which Harsanyi doesn't do for us.</p><p>Imagine you and me are trying to split a dollar. If we can't agree on how to split it, then we'll end up destroying it (ripping it during a desperate attempt to wrestle it from each other's hands, obviously). Thankfully, John Nash is standing by, and we each agree to respect his judgement. No matter which of us claims to value the dollar more, Nash will allocate 50 cents to each of us.</p><p>Harsanyi happens to see this exchange, and explains that Nash has chosen a social choice function which normalized our utility functions to be equal to each other. That's the only way Harsanyi can explain the choice made by Nash -- the value of the dollar was precisely tied between you and me, so a 50-50 split was as good as any other outcome. Harsanyi's justification is indeed <i>consistent</i> with the observation. But why, then, did Nash choose 50-50 <i>precisely?</i> 49-51 would have had exactly the same collective utility, as would 40-60, or any other split!</p><p>Hence, Nash's principle is far more useful than Harsanyi's, even though Harsanyi can justify any rational outcome retrospectively.</p><p>However, Nash does rely somewhat on that pesky IIA assumption, whose importance is perhaps not so clear. Let's try getting rid of that.</p><h2 id=\"Kalai_Smorodinsky\">Kalai–Smorodinsky</h2><p>Although the Nash bargaining solution is the most famous, there are other proposed solutions to Nash's bargaining problem.

Nash bargaining now hands the entire dollar to me, because you are \"up $20\" in that deal, so the fairest possible outcome is to give me the $1.

Something like a plant might have quite deterministic ways of reacting to environmental stimulus. Can we view it as making choices, and thus, as having preferences? Perhaps \"to some degree\" -- if such a degree could be defined, numerically, it could factor into utility comparisons, giving a formal way of valuing plants and animals <i>somewhat, </i>but \"not too much\".</p><h1 id=\"Altruistic_agents_\">Altruistic agents.</h1><p>Another puzzling case, which I think needs to be handled carefully, is accounting for the preferences of altruistic agents.</p><p>Let's proceed with a simplistic model where agents have \"personal preferences\" (preferences which just have to do with themselves, in some sense) and \"<i><strong>cofrences</strong></i>\" (co-preferences; preferences having to do with other agents).</p><p>Here's an agent named Sandy:</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Sandy</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Personal Preferences</td><td colspan=\"3\">Cofrences</td></tr><tr><td>Candy</td><td>+.1</td><td>Alice</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.1</td></tr><tr><td>Pizza</td><td>+.2</td><td>Bob</td><td colspan=\"2\">-.2</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbows</td><td>+10</td><td>Cathy</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.3</td></tr><tr><td>Kittens</td><td>-20</td><td>Dennis</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The cofrences represent coefficients on other agent's utility functions. Sandy's preferences are supposed to be understood as a utility function representing Sandy's <i>personal</i> preferences, plus a weighted sum of the utility functions of Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Dennis. (Note that the weights can, hypothetically, be negative -- for example, screw Bob.)</p><p>The first problem is that utility functions are not comparable, so we have to say more before we can understand what \"weighted sum\" is supposed to mean. But suppose we've chosen some utility normalization technique. There are still other problems.</p><p>Notice that we can't totally define Sandy's utility function until we've defined Alice's, Bob's, Cathy's, and Dennis'. But any of those four might have cofrences which involve Sandy, as well!</p><p>Suppose we have Avery and Briar, two lovers who \"only care about each other\" -- their only preference is a cofrence, which places 1.0 value on the other's utility function. We could ascribe <i>any values at all</i> to them, so long as they're both the same!</p><p>With some technical assumptions (something along the lines of: your cofrences always sum to less than 1), we can ensure a unique fixed point, eliminating any ambiguity from the interpretation of cofrences. However, I'm skeptical of just taking the fixed point here.</p><p>Suppose we have five siblings: Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, et Quintus. All of them value each other at .1, except Primus, who values all siblings at .2.</p><p>If we simply take the fixed point, Primus is going to get the short end of the stick all the time: because Primus cares about everyone else more, everyone else cares about Primus' personal preferences <i>less</i> than anyone else's.</p><p>Simply put, I don't think more altruistic individuals should be punished! In this setup, the \"utility monster\" is the perfectly selfish individual. Altruists will be scrambling to help this person while the selfish person does nothing in return.</p><p>A different way to do things is to interpret cofrences as <i>integrating only the personal preferences of the other person.</i> So Sandy wants to help Alice, Cathy, and Dennis (and harm Bob), but does <i>not</i> automatically extend that to wanting to help any of their friends (or harm Bob's friends).</p><p>This is a little weird, but gives us a more intuitive outcome in the case of the five siblings: Primus will more often be voluntarily helpful to the other siblings, but the other siblings won't be prejudice <i>against</i> the personal preferences of Primus when weighing between their various siblings.</p><p>I realize altruism isn't <i>exactly</i> supposed to be like a bargain struck between selfish agents. But if I think of utilitarianism like a coalition of all agents, then I don't want it to punish the (selfish component of) the most altruistic members. It seems like utilitarianism should have better incentives than that?</p><p>(Try to take this section as more of a problem statement and less of a solution.

Presumably this claim could be backed up, on the strength of your argument for the utility-comparison approach.</p><h1 id=\"Average_utilitarianism_vs_total_utilitarianism__\">Average utilitarianism vs total utilitarianism.&nbsp;</h1><p>Now that we have given some options for utility comparison, can we use them to make sense of the distinction between average utilitarianism and total utilitarianism?</p><p>No. Utility comparison doesn't really help us there.</p><p>The average vs total debate is a debate about population ethics.

There is no rule against this. An agent can prefer to have different preferences than it does. A collective of agents can prefer to extend its altruism to new agents who come into existence.</p><p>However, I see no reason why population ethics needs to be <i>simple</i>. We can have relatively complex preferences here. So, I don't find paradoxes such as the Repugnant Conclusion to be especially concerning.

      "markdown": "*(This is a basic point about utility theory which many will already be familiar with. I draw some non-obvious conclusions which may be of interest to you even if you think you know this from the title -- but the main point is to communicate the basics. I'm posting it to the alignment forum because I've heard misunderstandings of this from some in the AI alignment research community.)*\n\nI will first give the basic argument that the utility quantities of different agents aren't directly comparable, and a few important consequences of this. I'll then spend the rest of the post discussing what to do when you need to compare utility functions.\n\nUtilities aren't comparable.\n============================\n\nUtility isn't an ordinary quantity. A utility function is a device for expressing the preferences of an agent.\n\nSuppose we have a notion of *outcome.** We could try to represent the agent's preferences between outcomes as an ordering relation: if we have outcomes A, B, and C, then one possible preference would be A<B<C.\n\nHowever, a mere ordering does not tell us how the agent would decide between *gambles,* ie, situations giving A, B, and C with some probability.\n\nWith just three outcomes, there is only one thing we need to know: is B closer to A or C, and by how much?\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/70c2563b8fe60460a975a6000ca0aee95873c72e7fbbe2ce.png)\n\nWe want to construct a utility function U() which represents the preferences. Let's say we set U(A)=0 and U(C)=1. Then we can represent B=G as U(B)=1/2. If not, we would look for a different gamble which *does* equal B, and then set B's utility to the expected value of that gamble. By assigning real-numbered values to each outcome, we can fully represent an agent's preferences over gambles. (Assuming the [VNM axioms](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F46jPraqp258q67nE/why-you-must-maximize-expected-utility) hold, that is.)\n\nBut the initial choices U(A)=0 and U(C)=1 were arbitrary! We could have chosen any numbers so long as U(A)<U(C), reflecting the preference A<C. In general, a valid representation of our preferences U() can be modified into an equally valid U'() by adding/subtracting arbitrary numbers, or multiplying/dividing by positive numbers.\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/727725a2910022ba355875e1cebc211b70ab91529a3900f2.png)\n\nSo it's just as valid to say someone's expected utility in a given situation is 5 or -40, provided you shift everything *else* around appropriately.\n\nWriting \\\\(\\\\approx\\\\) to mean that two utility functions represent the same preferences, what we have in general is: \\\\(U\\_1(x) \\\\approx U\\_2(x)\\\\) if and only if \\\\(U\\_1(x) = aU\\_2+b\\\\). (I'll call \\\\(a\\\\) the ***multiplicative constant*** and\\\\(b\\\\)the ***additive constant***.)\n\nThis means that we can't directly compare the utility of two different agents. Notions of fairness should not directly say \"everyone should have the same expected utility\". Utilitarian ethics cannot directly maximize the sum of everyone's utility. Both of these operations should be thought of as a type error.\n\nSome non-obvious consequences.\n==============================\n\nThe game-theory term \"zero sum\" is a misnomer. You shouldn't directly think about the sum of the utilities.\n\nIn mechanism design, *exchangeable utility* is a useful assumption which is often needed in order to get nice results. The idea is that agents can give utils to each other, perhaps to compensate for unfair outcomes. This is *kind of* like assuming there's money which can be exchanged between agents. However, the non-comparability of utility should make this seem *really weird*. (There are also other disanalogies with money; for example, utility is closer to logarithmic in money, not linear.)\n\nThis could (should?) also make you suspicious of talk of \"average utilitarianism\" and \"total utilitarianism\". However, beware: only one kind of \"utilitarianism\" holds that the term \"utility\" in decision theory means the same thing as \"utility\" in ethics: namely, preference utilitarianism. Other kinds of utilitarianism can distinguish between these two types of utility. (For example, one can be a hedonic utilitarian without thinking that what everyone wants is happiness, if one isn't a preference utilitarian.)\n\nSimilarly, for preference utilitarians, talk of *utility monsters* becomes questionable. A utility monster is, supposedly, someone who gets much more utility out of resources than everyone else. For a hedonic utilitarian, it would be someone who experiences much deeper sadness and much higher heights of happiness. This person supposedly merits more resources than other people.\n\nFor a preference utilitarian, incomparability of utility means we can't simply posit such a utility monster. It's meaningless *a priori* to say that one person simply has much stronger preferences than another (in the utility function sense).\n\nAll that being said, we *can* actually compare utilities, sum them, exchange utility between agents, define utility monsters, and so on. We just need *more information.*\n\nComparing utilities.\n====================\n\nThe incomparability of utility functions ***doesn't mean*** we can't trade off between the utilities of different people.\n\nI've heard the non-comparability of utility functions summarized as the thesis that we can't say anything meaningful about the relative value of one person's suffering vs another person's convenience. Not so! Rather, the point is just that *we need more assumptions in order to say anything.* The utility functions alone aren't enough.\n\nPareto-Optimality: The Minimal Standard\n---------------------------------------\n\nComparing utility functions suggests putting them all onto one scale, such that we can trade off between them -- \"this dollar does more good for Alice than it does for Bob\". We formalize this by imagining that we have to decide policy for the whole group of people we're considering (e.g., the whole world). We consider a *social choice function* which would make those decisions on behalf of everyone. Supposing it is VNM rational, its decisions must be comprehensible in terms of a utility function, too. So the problem reduces to combining a bunch of individual utility functions, to get one big one.\n\nSo, how do we go about combining the preferences of many agents into one?\n\nThe first and most important concept is the ***pareto improvement:** our social choice function should endorse changes which benefit someone and harm no one.* An option which allows no such improvements is said to be ***Pareto-optimal.***\n\nWe might also want to consider ***strict Pareto improvements:** a change which benefits everyone.* (An option which allows no strict Pareto improvements is ***weakly Pareto-optimal.***) Strict Pareto improvements can be more relevant [in a bargaining context](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037554e/distributed-cooperation?commentId=5bd75cc58225bf0670375550), where you need to give everyone something in order to get them on board with a proposal -- otherwise they may judge the improvement as unfairly favoring others. However, in a bargaining context, individuals may refuse even a strict Pareto improvement [due to fairness considerations](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z2YwmzuT7nWx62Kfh/cooperating-with-agents-with-different-ideas-of-fairness).\n\nIn either case, a version of [Harsanyi's utilitarianism Theorem](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sZuw6SGfmZHvcAAEP/complete-class-consequentialist-foundations#Utilitarianism) implies that the utility of our social choice function *can be understood as some linear combination of the individual utility functions.*\n\nSo, pareto-optimal social choice functions can always be understood by:\n\n1.  Choosing a scale for everyone's utility function -- IE, set the multiplicative constant. (If the social choice function is only weakly Pareto optimal, some of the multiplicative constants might turn out to be zero, totally cancelling out someone's involvement. Otherwise, they can all be positive.)\n2.  Adding all of them together.\n\n(Note that the *additive constant* doesn't matter -- shifting a person's utility function up or down doesn't change what decisions will be endorsed by the sum. However, it ***will*** matter for some other ways to combine utility functions.)\n\nThis is nice, because we can always combine everything linearly! We just have to set things to the right scale and then sum everything up.\n\nHowever, it's far from the end of the story. How do we choose multiplicative constants for everybody?\n\nVariance Normalization: Not Too Exploitable?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe could set the constants any way we want... totally subjective estimates of the worth of a person, draw random lots, etc. But we do typically want to represent some notion of fairness. We said in the beginning that the problem was, a utility function \\\\(U(x)\\\\) has many equivalent representations \\\\(aU(x)+b\\\\). We can address this as a problem of ***normalization:*** we want to take a \\\\(U\\\\) and put it into a canonical form, getting rid of the choice between equivalent representations.\n\nOne way of thinking about this is ***strategy-proofness***. A utilitarian collective should not be vulnerable to members strategically claiming that their preferences are stronger (larger \\\\(b\\\\)), or that they should get more because they're worse off than everyone (smaller \\\\(a\\\\) \\-\\- although, remember that we haven't talked about any setup which actually cares about that, yet).\n\n**Warm-Up: Range Normalization**\n\nUnfortunately, some obvious ways to normalize utility functions are not going to be strategy-proof.\n\nOne of the simplest normalization techniques is to squish everything into a specified range, such as \\[0,1\\]:\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/03741ee30577de57315ff2adadd3be3ffd475eee72d31430.png)\n\nThis is analogous to range voting: everyone reports their preferences for different outcomes on a fixed scale, and these all get summed together in order to make decisions.\n\nIf you're an agent in a collective which uses range normalization, then you may want to strategically mis-report your preferences. In the example shown, the agent has a big hump around outcomes they like, and a small hump on a secondary \"just OK\" outcome. The agent might want to get rid of the second hump, forcing the group outcome into the more favored region.\n\nI believe that in the extreme, the optimal strategy for range voting is to choose some utility threshold. Anything below that threshold goes to zero, feigning maximal disapproval of the outcome. Anything above the threshold goes to one, feigning maximal approval. In other words, under strategic voting, range voting becomes approval voting (range voting where the only options are zero and one).\n\nIf it's not possible to mis-report your preferences, then the incentive becomes to *self-modify to literally have these extreme preferences.* This could perhaps have a real-life analogue in political outrage and black-and-white thinking. If we use this normalization scheme, that's the closest you can get to being a utility monster.\n\n**Variance Normalization**\n\nWe'd *like* to avoid *any* incentive to misrepresent/modify your utility function. Is there a way to achieve that?\n\nOwen Cotton-Barratt discusses different normalization techniques in illuminating detail, and argues for *variance normalization:* divide utility functions by their variance, making the variance one. ([*Geometric reasons for normalizing variance to aggregate preferences,* O Cotton-Barratt, 2013.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.684.1180&rep=rep1&type=pdf)) Variance normalization is strategy-proof under the assumption that everyone participating in an election shares beliefs about how probable the different outcomes are! (Note that *variance* *of utility* is only well-defined under some assumption about *probability of outcome.*) That's pretty good. It's probably the best we can get, in terms of strategy-proofness of voting. Will MacAskill also argues for variance normalization in the context of normative uncertainty ([*Normative Uncertainty,* Will MacAskill, 2014](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/34857095/Normative_Uncertainty__Complete.pdf?1411561048=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DNormative_Uncertainty.pdf&Expires=1599854518&Signature=Z-cD7ds~K1cZc-GlXyV~eppzxbVKlwJCIkz6AQIHUg4jOgQlMAcgi3X1cCX~Z~FSvXKAYEwTyqehuuxCkMA2hxguilao82uaF8cH7sEZxczg243o2S5k4sZ7-YeIp5cJ2U-UAsecA-JbROuHU9AkUnlR02-rL4q-JlAlCOBBP5CDjJC6aocEM1HEyL0bHxFXf7Wg~B4Jyf8KSlvdnuAbm7IFn~lbmrBLb6OQG5~VbGAz8rfH2AuZlbZOpdVoID~MgPtIZ9rF1kMAcrUAhS93D15BPd8XNDRAOtMKMvSs~5xh5Ok-7dQhTFhqXkk~YE4S23VoKGGwqGZp4yl9X6WnTQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA)).\n\nIntuitively, variance normalization directly addresses the issue we encountered with range normalization: an individual attempts to make their preferences \"loud\" by extremizing everything to 0 or 1. This increases variance, so, is directly punished by variance normalization.\n\nHowever, [Jameson Quinn](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jameson-quinn), LessWrong's resident voting theory expert, has warned me rather strongly about variance normalization.\n\n1.  The assumption of shared beliefs about election outcomes is far from true in practice. Jameson Quinn tells me that, in fact, the strategic voting incentivized by quadratic voting is *particularly bad* amongst normalization techniques.\n2.  Strategy-proofness isn't, after all, the final arbiter of the quality of a voting method. The final arbiter should be something like the utilitarian quality of an election's outcome. This question gets a bit weird and recursive in the current context, where I'm using elections as an analogy to ask how we should define utilitarian outcomes. But the point still, to some extent, stands.\n\nI didn't understand the full justification behind his point, but I came away thinking that range normalization was probably better in practice. After all, it reduces to approval voting, which is actually a pretty good form of voting. But if you want to do the best we can with the state of voting theory, Jameson Quinn suggested 3-2-1 voting. (I don't think 3-2-1 voting gives us any nice theory about how to combine utility functions, though, so it isn't so useful for our purposes.)\n\n**Open Question:** *Is there a variant of variance normalization which takes differing beliefs into account, to achieve strategy-proofness (IE honest reporting of utility)?*\n\nAnyway, so much for normalization techniques. These techniques ignore the broader context. They attempt to be fair and even-handed *in the way we choose the multiplicative and additive constants.* But we could also explicitly try to be fair and even-handed *in the way we choose between Pareto-optimal outcomes*, as with this next technique.\n\nNash Bargaining Solution\n------------------------\n\nIt's important to remember that the Nash bargaining solution is a solution *to the Nash bargaining problem*, which isn't quite our problem here. But I'm going to gloss over that. Just imagine that we're setting the social choice function through a massive negotiation, so that we can apply bargaining theory.\n\nNash offers a very simple solution, which I'll get to in a minute. But first, a few words on how this solution is derived. Nash provides two seperate justifications for his solution. The first is a game-theoretic derivation of the solution as an especially robust Nash equilibrium. I won't detail that here; I quite recommend [his original paper](http://www.rasmusen.org/GI/reader/12a.nash.bargaining.1950.pdf) (*The Bargaining Problem,* 1950); but, just keep in mind that there is at least some reason to expect selfishly rational agents to hit upon this particular solution. The second, unrelated justification is an axiomatic one:\n\n1.  *Invariance to equivalent utility functions.* This is the same motivation I gave when discussing normalization.\n2.  *Pareto optimality.* We've already discussed this as well.\n3.  *Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA).* This says that we shouldn't change the outcome of bargaining by removing options which won't ultimately get chosen anyway. This isn't even technically one of the VNM axioms, but it *essentially* is -- the VNM axioms are posed for binary preferences (a > b). IIA is the assumption we need to break down multi-choice preferences to binary choices. We can justify IIA with [a kind of money pump](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf067037539a/generalizing-foundations-of-decision-theory-ii).\n4.  *Symmetry.* This says that the outcome doesn't depend on the order of the bargainers; we don't prefer Player 1 in case of a tie, or anything like that.\n\nNash proved that *the only way to meet these four criteria* is to maximize the **product** of gains from cooperation. More formally, choose the outcome \\\\(x\\\\) which maximizes:\n\n\\\\\\[(U\\_1(x) - U\\_1(d))(U\\_2(x)-U\\_2(d))\\\\\\]\n\nThe \\\\(d\\\\) here is a \"status quo\" outcome. You can think of this as what happens if the bargaining fails. This is sometimes called a \"threat point\", since strategic players should carefully set what they do *if negotiation fails* so as to maximize their bargaining position. However, you might also want to rule that out, forcing \\\\(d\\\\) to be a Nash equilibrium in the hypothetical game where there is no bargaining opportunity. As such, \\\\(d\\\\) is also known as the *best alternative to negotiated agreement (BATNA)*, or sometimes the \"disagreement point\" (since it's what players get if they can't agree). We can think of subtracting out \\\\(U(d)\\\\) as just a way of adjusting the additive constant, in which case we really are just maximizing the product of utilities. (The BATNA point is always (0,0) after we subtract out things that way.)\n\nThe Nash solution differs significantly from the other solutions considered so far.\n\n1.  Maximize the *product??* Didn't Harsanyi's theorem guarantee we only need to worry about sums?\n2.  This is the first proposal where the additive constants matter. Indeed, now the *multiplicative* constants are the ones that don't matter!\n3.  Why wouldn't *any* utility-normalization approach satisfy those four axioms?\n\nLast question first: how do normalization approaches violate the Nash axioms?\n\nWell, both range normalization and variance normalization violate IIA! If you remove one of the possible outcomes, the normalization may change. This makes the social choice function display inconsistent preferences across different scenarios. (But how bad is that, really?)\n\nAs for why we can get away with maximizing the product, rather than the sum:\n\nThe Pareto-optimality of Nash's approach guarantees that it *can be seen* as maximizing a linear function of the individual utilities. So Harsanyi's theorem is still satisfied. However, Nash's solution points to a very *specific* outcome, which Harsanyi doesn't do for us.\n\nImagine you and me are trying to split a dollar. If we can't agree on how to split it, then we'll end up destroying it (ripping it during a desperate attempt to wrestle it from each other's hands, obviously). Thankfully, John Nash is standing by, and we each agree to respect his judgement. No matter which of us claims to value the dollar more, Nash will allocate 50 cents to each of us.\n\nHarsanyi happens to see this exchange, and explains that Nash has chosen a social choice function which normalized our utility functions to be equal to each other. That's the only way Harsanyi can explain the choice made by Nash -- the value of the dollar was precisely tied between you and me, so a 50-50 split was as good as any other outcome. Harsanyi's justification is indeed *consistent* with the observation. But why, then, did Nash choose 50-50 *precisely?* 49-51 would have had exactly the same collective utility, as would 40-60, or any other split!\n\nHence, Nash's principle is far more useful than Harsanyi's, even though Harsanyi can justify any rational outcome retrospectively.\n\nHowever, Nash does rely somewhat on that pesky IIA assumption, whose importance is perhaps not so clear. Let's try getting rid of that.\n\nKalai–Smorodinsky\n-----------------\n\nAlthough the Nash bargaining solution is the most famous, there are other proposed solutions to Nash's bargaining problem. I want to mention just one more, Kalai-Smorodinsky (I'll call it KS).\n\nKS throws out IIA as irrelevant. After all, the set of alternatives *will* affect bargaining. Even in the Nash solution, the set of alternatives may have an influence by changing the BATNA! So perhaps this assumption isn't so important.\n\nKS instead adds a *monotonicity* assumption: being in a better position should never make me worse off after bargaining.\n\nHere's an illustration, due to Daniel Demski, of a case where Nash bargaining fails monotonicity:\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/b6d1b6bb67fe303b168677d37fe682f817d68581879f57e5.jpeg)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c52e2fe0e1c0400436e528b5f0ac1f471310bb4315160e57.jpeg)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/723a1686fe305c117cc468de3a53f2a53de729844a708241.jpeg)\n\nI'm not that sure monotonicity really should be an axiom, but it does kind of suck to be in an apparently better position and end up worse off for it. Maybe we could relate this to strategy-proofness? A little? Not sure about that.\n\nLet's look at the formula for KS bargaining. \n\nSuppose there are a couple of dollars on the ground: one which you'll walk by first, and one which I'll walk by. If you pick up your dollar, you can keep it. If I pick up my dollar, I can keep mine. But also, if you *don't* pick up yours, then I'll eventually walk by it and can pick it up. So we get the following:\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/33ae90d543db57832167eb6920b1bf257e65b1c23da49b99.png)\n\n(The box is filled in because we can also use mixed strategies to get values intermediate between any pure strategies.)\n\nObviously in the real world we just both pick up our dollars. But, let's suppose we bargain about it, just for fun.\n\nThe way KS works is, you look at the maximum *one* player can get (you can get $1), and the maximum the *other* player could get (I can get $2). Then, although we can't usually jointly achieve those payoffs (I can't get $2 at the same time as you get $1), KS bargaining insists we achieve the same *ratio* (I should get twice as much as you). In this case, that means I get $1.33, while you get $0.66. We can visualize this as drawing a bounding box around the feasible solutions, and drawing a diagonal line. Here's the Nash and KS solutions side by side:\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/6d3cf95df139e51c156cd92879c6754ce2b4addeb3d6ce93.png)\n\nAs in Daniel's illustrations, we can visualize maximizing the product as drawing the largest hyperbola we can that still touches the orange shape. (Orange dotted line.) This suggests that we each get $1; exactly the same solution as Nash would give for splitting $2. (The black dotted line illustrates how we'd continue the feasible region to represent a dollar-splitting game, getting the full triangle rather than a chopped off portion.) Nash doesn't care that one of us can do better than the other; it just looks for the most equal division of funds possible, since that's how we maximize the product.\n\nKS, on the other hand, cares what the max possible is for both of us. It therefore suggests that you give up some of your dollar to me.\n\nI suspect most readers will ***not*** find the KS solution to be more intuitively appealing?\n\nNote that the KS monotonicity property does NOT imply the desirable-sounding property \"if there are more opportunities for good outcomes, everyone gets more or is at least not worse off.\" (I mention this mainly because I initially misinterpreted KS's monotonicity property this way.) In my dollar-collecting example, KS bargaining makes you worse off simply because there's an opportunity for me to take your dollar if you don't. \n\nLike Nash bargaining, KS bargaining ignores multiplicative constants on utility functions, and can be seen as normalizing additive constants by treating \\\\(d\\\\) as (0,0). (Note that, in the illustration, I assumed \\\\(d\\\\) is chosen as (minimal achievable for one player, minimal achievable for the other). this need not be the case in general.)\n\nA peculiar aspect of KS bargaining is that it doesn't really give us an obvious quantity to maximize, unlike Nash or Harsanyi. It only describes the optimal point. This seems far less practical, for realistic decision-making.\n\nOK, so, should we use bargaining solutions to compare utilities?\n\nMy intuition is that, because of the need to choose the BATNA point \\\\(d\\\\), bargaining solutions end up rewarding destructive threats in a disturbing way. For example, suppose that we are playing the dollar-splitting game again, except that I can costlessly destroy $20 of your money, so \\\\(d\\\\) now involves both the destruction of the $1, and the destruction of $20. Nash bargaining now hands the entire dollar to me, because you are \"up $20\" in that deal, so the fairest possible outcome is to give me the $1. KS bargaining splits things up a little, but I still get most of the dollar.\n\nIf utilitarians were to trade off utilities that way in the real world, it would benefit powerful people, especially those willing to exploit their power to make credible threats. If X can take everything away from Y, then Nash bargaining sees everything Y has as already counting toward \"gains from trade\".\n\nAs I mentioned before, sometimes people try to define BATNAs in a way which excludes these kinds of threats. However, I see this as ripe for strategic utility-spoofing (IE, lying about your preferences, or self-modifying to have more advantageous preferences).\n\nSo, this might favor normalization approaches.\n\nOn the other hand, Nash and KS both do way better in the split-the-dollar game than any normalization technique, because they can optimize for fairness of outcome, rather than just fairness of multiplicative constants chosen to compare utility functions with.\n\nIs there any approach which combines the advantages of bargaining and normalization??\n\nAnimals, etc.\n=============\n\nAn essay on utility comparison would be incomplete without at least mentioning the problem of animals, plants, and so on.\n\n*   Option one: some cutoff for \"moral patients\" is defined, such that a utilitarian only considers preferences of agents who exceed the cutoff.\n*   Option two: some more continuous notion is selected, such that we care more about some organisms than others.\n\nOption two tends to be more appealing to me, despite the non-egalitarian implications (e.g., if animals differ on this spectrum, than humans could have some variation as well). \n\nAs already discussed, bargaining approaches do seem to have this feature: animals would tend to get less consideration, because they've got less \"bargaining power\" (they can do less harm to humans than humans can do to them). However, this has a distasteful might-makes-right flavor to it.\n\nThis also brings to the forefront the question of how we view something as an agent. Something like a plant might have quite deterministic ways of reacting to environmental stimulus. Can we view it as making choices, and thus, as having preferences? Perhaps \"to some degree\" -- if such a degree could be defined, numerically, it could factor into utility comparisons, giving a formal way of valuing plants and animals *somewhat,* but \"not too much\".\n\nAltruistic agents.\n==================\n\nAnother puzzling case, which I think needs to be handled carefully, is accounting for the preferences of altruistic agents.\n\nLet's proceed with a simplistic model where agents have \"personal preferences\" (preferences which just have to do with themselves, in some sense) and \"***cofrences***\" (co-preferences; preferences having to do with other agents).\n\nHere's an agent named Sandy:\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Sandy</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Personal Preferences</td><td colspan=\"3\">Cofrences</td></tr><tr><td>Candy</td><td>+.1</td><td>Alice</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.1</td></tr><tr><td>Pizza</td><td>+.2</td><td>Bob</td><td colspan=\"2\">-.2</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbows</td><td>+10</td><td>Cathy</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.3</td></tr><tr><td>Kittens</td><td>-20</td><td>Dennis</td><td colspan=\"2\">+.4</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe cofrences represent coefficients on other agent's utility functions. Sandy's preferences are supposed to be understood as a utility function representing Sandy's *personal* preferences, plus a weighted sum of the utility functions of Alice, Bob, Cathy, and Dennis. (Note that the weights can, hypothetically, be negative -- for example, screw Bob.)\n\nThe first problem is that utility functions are not comparable, so we have to say more before we can understand what \"weighted sum\" is supposed to mean. But suppose we've chosen some utility normalization technique. There are still other problems.\n\nNotice that we can't totally define Sandy's utility function until we've defined Alice's, Bob's, Cathy's, and Dennis'. But any of those four might have cofrences which involve Sandy, as well!\n\nSuppose we have Avery and Briar, two lovers who \"only care about each other\" -- their only preference is a cofrence, which places 1.0 value on the other's utility function. We could ascribe *any values at all* to them, so long as they're both the same!\n\nWith some technical assumptions (something along the lines of: your cofrences always sum to less than 1), we can ensure a unique fixed point, eliminating any ambiguity from the interpretation of cofrences. However, I'm skeptical of just taking the fixed point here.\n\nSuppose we have five siblings: Primus, Secundus, Tertius, Quartus, et Quintus. All of them value each other at .1, except Primus, who values all siblings at .2.\n\nIf we simply take the fixed point, Primus is going to get the short end of the stick all the time: because Primus cares about everyone else more, everyone else cares about Primus' personal preferences *less* than anyone else's.\n\nSimply put, I don't think more altruistic individuals should be punished! In this setup, the \"utility monster\" is the perfectly selfish individual. Altruists will be scrambling to help this person while the selfish person does nothing in return.\n\nA different way to do things is to interpret cofrences as *integrating only the personal preferences of the other person.* So Sandy wants to help Alice, Cathy, and Dennis (and harm Bob), but does *not* automatically extend that to wanting to help any of their friends (or harm Bob's friends).\n\nThis is a little weird, but gives us a more intuitive outcome in the case of the five siblings: Primus will more often be voluntarily helpful to the other siblings, but the other siblings won't be prejudice *against* the personal preferences of Primus when weighing between their various siblings.\n\nI realize altruism isn't *exactly* supposed to be like a bargain struck between selfish agents. But if I think of utilitarianism like a coalition of all agents, then I don't want it to punish the (selfish component of) the most altruistic members. It seems like utilitarianism should have better incentives than that?\n\n(Try to take this section as more of a problem statement and less of a solution. Note that the concept of *cofrence* can include, more generally, preferences such as \"I want to be better off than other people\" or \"I don't want my utility to be too different from other people's in either direction\".)\n\nUtility monsters.\n=================\n\nReturning to some of the points I raised in the \"non-obvious consequences\" section -- now we can see how \"utility monsters\" are/aren't a concern.\n\nOn my analysis, a utility monster is just an agent who, according to your metric for comparing utility functions, has a very large influence on the social choice function.\n\nThis might be a bug, in which case you should reconsider how you are comparing utilities. But, since you've hopefully chosen your approach carefully, it could also not be a bug. In that case, you'd want to bite the bullet fully, defending the claim that such an agent should receive \"disproportionate\" consideration. Presumably this claim could be backed up, on the strength of your argument for the utility-comparison approach.\n\nAverage utilitarianism vs total utilitarianism. \n================================================\n\nNow that we have given some options for utility comparison, can we use them to make sense of the distinction between average utilitarianism and total utilitarianism?\n\nNo. Utility comparison doesn't really help us there.\n\nThe average vs total debate is a debate about population ethics. Harsanyi's utilitarianism theorem and related approaches let us think about altruistic policies for a fixed set of agents. They don't tell us how to think about a set which changes over time, as new agents come into existence.\n\nAllowing the set to vary over time like this feels similar to allowing a single agent to change its utility function. There is no rule against this. An agent can prefer to have different preferences than it does. A collective of agents can prefer to extend its altruism to new agents who come into existence.\n\nHowever, I see no reason why population ethics needs to be *simple*. We can have relatively complex preferences here. So, I don't find paradoxes such as the Repugnant Conclusion to be especially concerning. To me there's just this complicated question about what everyone collectively wants for the future.\n\nOne of the basic questions about utilitarianism shouldn't be \"average vs total?\". To me, this is a type error. It seems to me, more basic questions for a (preference) utilitarian are:\n\n*   How do you combine individual preferences into a collective utility function?\n    *   How do you compare utilities between people (and animals, etc)?\n        *   Do you care about an \"objective\" solution to this, or do you see it as a subjective aspect of altruistic preferences, which can be set in an unprincipled way?\n        *   Do you range-normalize?\n        *   Do you variance-normalize?\n        *   Do you care about strategy-proofness?\n        *   How do you evaluate the bargaining framing? Is it relevant, or irrelevant?\n        *   Do you care about Nash's axioms?\n        *   Do you care about monotonicity?\n        *   What distinguishes humans from animals and plants, and how do you use it in utility comparison? Intelligence? Agenticness? Power? Bargaining position?\n    *   How do you handle cofrences?\n\n*: Agents need not have a concept of outcome, in which case they [don't really have a utility function](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/A8iGaZ3uHNNGgJeaD/an-orthodox-case-against-utility-functions) (because utility functions are functions *of outcomes*). However, this does not significantly impact any of the points made in this post."

The hope is that, given good protocol, damage incurred during the freezing process will not destroy enough information about you to prevent people in the future from reconstructing your identity.\n\nAs most who want cryonics will understand, death is not an event. Instead, it is a process with intermediate steps. We consider a long-decayed corpse to be dead because it no longer performs the functions associated with a normal living human being, not because any sort of spirit or soul has left the body.\n\nBut philosophers have also identified important dilemmas for the view that death is a process rather than an event. If what we call death is simply my body performing different functions, then what do we make of the fact that we also change so much simply due to the passage of time?\n\nI find it easy to believe that I am the 'same person' as I was last night. Enough of the neural pathways are still the same. Memories from my childhood are essentially still identical. My personality has not changed any significant extent. My values and beliefs remain more-or-less intact.\n\nBut every day brings small changes to our identity. To what extent would you say that you are still the 'same person' as you were when you were a child? And to what extent are you still going to be the 'same person' when you get old?\n\nIn addition to the gradual changes that happen due to every day metabolic processes, and interactions with the outside world, there is also a more sudden change that may happen to your identity as you get old. By the age of 85, something like 25 to 50 percent of the population will get a form of dementia. Alzheimer's is a very harsh transformation to our connectome.\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Alzheimer%27s_disease_brain_comparison.jpg/1920px-Alzheimer%27s_disease_brain_comparison.jpg)\n\nIronically, those who are healthiest in their youth will have the highest chance of getting Alzhiemers, as it is typically a disease of the very-old, rather than the somewhat old. Furthermore, most forecasters expect that as medical technology advances, the rate of Alzhiemers [will go _up_](https://www.alzforum.org/news/conference-coverage/alzheimers-incidence-rising-not-falling-researcher-says), since it's among the hardest diseases to fix with our current paradigm of medical technology, and therefore you won't be as likely to die of the others. And Alzhiemers is just one brand of [neurodegenerative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration) diseases.\n\nIf you care about preserving your current self, and you think that death is a process rather than event, then it follows that you should want to preserve your current self: memories, personality, beliefs, values, mannerisms etc.\n\nThe technology to store the contents of our brains is currently extremely limited and expensive, but we have an alternative. We can store external information about ourselves, in the form of [lifelogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog). The type of content we preserve can take a variety of forms, such as text, audio and video.\n\nIt might seem like preserving an audio of your voice will do little to restore your identity. But that might not be the case. If you are cryopreserved, then much of your connectome will be preserved anyway. The primary value of preserving external information is to 'fill in the blanks' so to speak.\n\nFor example, the most famous symptom of Alzheimers is memory loss. This occurs because the hippocampus, the primary component of our brain responsible for storing long-term memories, shrinks radically during the progression of the disease. If you consider memory to be important to your identity, then preserving external information about you could help function as an artificial memory source.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that if death is a process, it's not correct to say that you will either be revived or not in the future, like a binary event. Rather, _part_ of you will be revived. How much that part resembles you depends on how much information about you is preserved.\n\nThere are many clever methods I currently see for how future civilization could reconstruct your identity using your cryopreserved brain contents, and external memory together. If you can't see how the external memory helps at all, then I consider that a fault of imagination.\n\nSome will object by saying that lifelogging is _embarrassing_, as you are carrying a camera or audio recording device wherever you go. Indeed, [most of the reason](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CEGnJBHmkcwPTysb7/lonely-dissent) why people don't sign up for cryonics in the first place is because they fear that their peers will not approve. Lifelogging makes this dire situation worse. But I think there are steps you can take to make the appeal better.\n\nThe more information you preserve now, the better. There's no sharp cutoff point between having too little information and having just enough. If you feel uncomfortable walking around with a camera (and who wouldn't?) you don't have to. But consider taking small steps. Perhaps when you are in a video call with someone, ask them if they are OK with you recording it and later storing it as an mp3 on a hard disk. Or maybe you could write more of your personal thoughts into documents, and upload them to Google Drive.\n\nLittle actions like that could add up, or not. I claim no silver bullet.\n\nPart of the worst part of death is how terrible we are at motivating ourselves to avoid it. Among people who say they are interested in signing up for cryonics, only a small fraction end up signing the paperwork. And among those who do, the number who get preserved in optimal conditions is far too low. It seems that outside pressure from society is simply too powerful.\n\nBut as indicated by the [Asch conformity experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments), the best way to overcome societal pressure is by having peers that agree with and encourage you. If just a few people took this post seriously, this could be enough to puncture the equilibrium, and perhaps a lot of people will be interested in recording their lives. Who knows?"

      "markdown": "Some time ago, Scott Alexander wrote about [asymmetric weapons](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/), and now he [writes again about them](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/06/asymmetric-weapons-gone-bad/). During these posts, Scott repeatedly characterizes asymmetric weapons as inherently stronger for the \"good guys\" than they are for the \"bad guys\". Here is a quote from his first post:\n\n> Logical debate has one advantage over narrative, rhetoric, and violence: it’s an _asymmetric weapon_. That is, it’s a weapon which is stronger in the hands of the good guys than in the hands of the bad guys.\n\nAnd here is a quote from his more recent one:\n\n> A symmetric weapon is one that works just as well for the bad guys as for the good guys. For example, violence – your morality doesn’t determine how hard you can punch; they can buy guns from the same places we can.\n\n> An asymmetric weapon is one that works better for the good guys than the bad guys. The example I gave was Reason. If everyone tries to solve their problems through figuring out what the right thing to do is, the good guys (who are right) will have an easier time proving themselves to be right than the bad guys (who are wrong). Finding and using asymmetric weapons is the only non-coincidence way to make sustained moral progress.\n\nOne problem with this concept is that _just because something is asymmetric doesn't mean that it's asymmetric in a good direction._\n\nScott talks about weapons that are asymmetric towards those who are right. However, there are many more types of asymmetries than just right vs. wrong - physical violence is asymmetric towards the strong, shouting people down is asymmetric towards the loud, and airing TV commercials is asymmetric towards people with more money. Violence isn't merely symmetric - it's _asymmetric in a bad direction_, since [fascists are better than violence than you](https://themiddleofthatzone.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/fascists-are-better-at-violence-than-you/).\n\nThis in turn means that various sides will all be trying to pull things in directions that are asymmetric to their advantage. Indeed, a basic principle in strategy is to try to shift conflicts into areas where you are strong and your opponent is weak.\n\nFor instance, people who are good at violence benefit from things getting violent. People who are locally popular benefit from popularity contests. People who have lots of free time benefit from time-consuming processes. People who are better at keeping their composure benefit from discourse norms that punish displays of emotion.\n\nDeveloping asymmetric processes that point towards truth is a good idea, and I'm all for it. But in practice there are also asymmetric processes that point towards error, or merely asymmetric processes that point towards what's currently popular or faddish. Those processes are, if anything, just as likely to have people trying to promote them than the pro-truth ones - perhaps more likely!\n\nThat doesn't make the people promoting those ideas \"anti-truth\" or whatever - they may not even be aware of what they're doing - but even so, people tend to respond to incentives, and those incentives may well pull them towards norms and methods that are asymmetric in their favor independent of whether those norms and methods promote truth."

You can put as much effort as you like into organising your goals, organising your To-Do lists, organising your calendar, but sooner or later you will be presented with more than one thing you could reasonably be doing with your time. When that happens, you will need some sort of method for choosing what that thing will be, and actually getting started.</p><p>Most people, I think, face this problem by either just doing the thing that is top-of-mind or looking through their To-Do list and picking something out. This works fine when the next thing to do is obvious, and you have no problems getting started on it. But when you have many potential things to do and aren’t sure which is best, or when you kind of know what the best next thing is but are avoiding it for one reason or another, you need a better system.</p><p>That system needs to be quick to execute, easy to remember, and effective at actually having you do the best next task. It needs to be robust to your psychological weaknesses, minimising procrastination, indecision, and ugh fields. It needs to be efficient, requiring as little work as possible to identify the most valuable task.</p><p>Enter <a href=\"http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html\"><u>Final Version Perfected</u></a>.</p><h1 id=\"The_FVP_Algorithm\"><strong>The FVP Algorithm</strong></h1><p>The algorithm for executing tasks under FVP is pretty simple. You can find a description of it by the designer <a href=\"http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html\"><u>here</u></a>, but here’s my version:</p><ol><li>Put all the tasks you have to choose from into one big unsorted list.</li><li><strong>Mark</strong> the first item on the list. <strong>Don’t do it yet.</strong></li><li>For each <i>subsequent</i> item on the list, ask yourself, \"Do I want to do this task more than the <i>last task I marked</i>?\" If yes, <strong>mark it</strong>. If no, <strong>don't mark it</strong>. Move on to the next item.</li><li>When you reach the end of the list, trace back up to find the bottom-most marked task. <strong>Do it</strong>, then <strong>cross it off</strong> the list.</li><li>Beginning with the next unmarked task <i>after the task you just crossed off</i>, repeat step 3, comparing each task to the bottom-most uncrossed marked task (i.e. the one prior to the one you just crossed out).</li><li>Go to step 4. Repeat until you run out of time or list items.</li></ol><p>In FVP, then, you perform a series of pairwise comparisons between tasks, in each case asking whether the new task is something you <i>want to do more than</i> the old task. The “want to do more than” comparison is deliberately vague: Depending on context, it might be the thing that would best move your project forward, the thing that would have the worst consequences if you didn’t do it, or the thing you would most enjoy doing. The key thing is that at each stage, you’re only comparing each task to the <i>most recent task you marked</i>, ignoring all previous tasks.</p><p>I'll talk more in a moment about why I think this algorithm is a good one, but first, let’s work through an example. (If you're sure you already understand the algorithm, click <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xfcKYznQ6B9yuxB28/final-version-perfected-an-underused-execution-algorithm#FVP__Why_and_why_not\">here</a> to go straight to the pros and cons.)</p><h1 id=\"A_long_ish_example\"><strong>A long-ish example</strong></h1><p>Let's say this is my to-do list for today:</p><ul><li>Buy milk</li><li>Finish term paper</li><li>Play video games</li><li>Work out</li><li>Save the world</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>I start by marking the first item:</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li>Finish term paper</li><li>Play video games</li><li>Work out</li><li>Save the world</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Then I compare it to the next item on the list.

I already decided I want to finish the term paper before buying milk, so I can ignore the milk for now. Do I want to play video games or finish my term paper? Well, in some sense I <i>want</i> to play video games more, but my all-things-considered <i>endorsement</i> is to finish the term paper first, so I leave item 3 unmarked.</p><p>Next, item 4: do I want to finish the term paper or work out? Well, in some sense I'd rather not do either, and in another sense the term paper is more urgent, but working out is important, I've heard it has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise\"><u>cognitive benefits</u></a>, and I know from experience that if I don't do it first thing I won't do it, so it takes precedence:</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><strong>× Finish term paper</strong></li><li>Play video games</li><li><strong>× Work out</strong></li><li>Save the world</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Item 5: oh yeah, I forgot, I need to save the world today. Damn. Well, I can't work out if there's no world to work out in, so I guess I’ll do that first.</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><strong>× Finish term paper</strong></li><li>Play video games</li><li><strong>× Work out</strong></li><li><strong>× Save the world</strong></li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Ditto for walking the dog: much though I love him, I won't have anywhere to walk him if I don't save the world first, so that takes precedence again.</p><p>I've finished the list now, so it's time to do the last item on the list. Looks like that's saving the world. Luckily, it doesn't take long:</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><strong>× Finish term paper</strong></li><li>Play video games</li><li><strong>× Work out</strong></li><li><s>× Save the world</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Now that I've done the highest priority task on the list, I go back to FVP to determine the next one. There's actually only one comparison I need to make: work out or walk the dog? Walking the dog can wait until the evening, so it’s time to head to the gym.</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><strong>× Finish term paper</strong></li><li>Play video games</li><li><s>× Work out</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><s>× Save the world</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Again, there's only one more comparison I need to do to determine my next top task: do I want to finish my term paper, or walk the dog?

But now there are <i>two</i> more comparisons to make to decide on the next task. First, do I want to buy milk, or play video games? I've worked pretty hard so far today, and buying milk isn't that important, so let's play games first:</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><s>× Finish term paper</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><strong>× Play video games</strong></li><li><s>× Work out</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><s>× Save the world</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li>Walk the dog</li></ul><p>Finally, do I want to walk the dog or play video games? The dog has been waiting for hours for a walk now, and I could do with some fresh air, and I'd feel guilty just gaming without taking him out, so let's do that first:</p><ul><li><strong>× Buy milk</strong></li><li><s>× Finish term paper</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><strong>× Play video games</strong></li><li><s>× Work out</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><s>× Save the world</s>&nbsp; ✓</li><li><strong>× Walk the dog</strong></li></ul><p>There's no unmarked tasks in the list now, so to finish I just work up the list in order: first walking the dog, then playing games, then, finally, buying milk.</p><h1 id=\"FVP__Why_and_why_not\"><strong>FVP: Why and why not</strong></h1><p>The usefulness of FVP depends on a few key assumptions.</p><ul><li>Firstly, the algorithm assumes your preferences are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation#Examples\"><u>transitive</u></a>, and that you can accurately assess the value of each task according to your preferences. These are pretty fundamental assumptions that will be integral to almost any list-based execution system. In reality, your preferences probably aren’t quite transitive, but hopefully they are close enough that pretending they are is reasonable. As for accurately assessing each task, well, no execution algorithm can prevent you from making any mistakes, but FVP is more effective than most at eliciting your best guesses.</li><li>Secondly, FVP assumes that your preferences are <strong>stable</strong> over the timeframe you're using it. If your preferences shift substantially over that period, such that you need to re-prioritise among the existing tasks on your list, you'll need to throw out your previous FVP and start again. This places some constraints on the timescale you can organise using a single FVP iteration: I seldom stick with the same iteration for longer than a day. (Note, though, that FVP can handle the addition of <i>new</i> tasks quite easily, as long as they don’t alter the existing order.)</li><li>Thirdly, the value of FVP is greatest when you are <strong>unsure</strong> about which task you should do next, and especially when you don’t have time to do every task you might want to do that day. I find FVP most useful when I have a lot of different tasks competing for my time; it is much less useful when my time is pre-allocated to a single, well-planned-out task.</li></ul><p>When these conditions are met, FVP is a <i>very</i> effective method for guiding action. It is both efficient and exhaustive: guaranteed to identify the top-priority task while avoiding most of the work involved in producing a complete ranking. It is a simple algorithm, easy to remember and quick to perform. After doing it for a while, I find it scarcely requires conscious thought – but still reliably identifies the most valuable task for me to work on.</p><p>The biggest benefit I get from FVP, though, is how much easier it makes it to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/ugh-fields-or-why-you-can-t-even-bear-to-think-about-that-task-5941837dac62\"><u>do important things I'd rather avoid</u></a>. There is something about a bald, pairwise comparison between two tasks that is highly effective at overcoming my aversion to difficult things. If an important but unpleasant task is nestled within a long to-do list of minor-but-rewarding busywork, it is easy for my eye to skip over the difficult task, defer it till tomorrow, and work on something more pleasant instead. It's much harder to do that when comparing the important task to each minor task in isolation.</p><p>FVP is also good at minimising <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass\"><u>time lost due to indecision</u></a>. When presented with a menu of tasks to choose from, it can be quite hard to select a single task to work on first. When that choice process is reduced to a series of simple pairwise comparisons, the choosing process as a whole becomes much easier. And, once I've finished with FVP and selected a single winning task, there's an impetus towards starting that makes me much less prone to procrastination.</p><p>One last brief note on infrastructure: due to its relative obscurity, I haven’t found great online tools for FVP. <a href=\"http://complice.co/\"><u>Complice</u></a>’s starred-task system can be passably adapted to the algorithm, but in general I’ve found physical paper lists to work best. When I was at work I would print off my Todoist task lists and use those; now I’m working from home I mostly write them out by hand. This is kind of time-consuming and redundant, so if you dislike paper notes and don’t have access to a printer it might be a significant mark against FVP.</p><p>I’d really love it if someone created a great online tool for FVP or integrated it more formally into an existing productivity application, but I don’t expect that to happen any time soon. In the meantime, if you have ideas for existing ways to execute FVP online, I’d love to hear about them!</p>",

You can find a description of it by the designer [here](http://markforster.squarespace.com/blog/2015/5/21/the-final-version-perfected-fvp.html), but here’s my version:\n\n1.  Put all the tasks you have to choose from into one big unsorted list.\n2.  **Mark** the first item on the list. **Don’t do it yet.**\n3.  For each *subsequent* item on the list, ask yourself, \"Do I want to do this task more than the *last task I marked*?\" If yes, **mark it**. If no, **don't mark it**. Move on to the next item.\n4.  When you reach the end of the list, trace back up to find the bottom-most marked task. **Do it**, then **cross it off** the list.\n5.  Beginning with the next unmarked task *after the task you just crossed off*, repeat step 3, comparing each task to the bottom-most uncrossed marked task (i.e. the one prior to the one you just crossed out).\n6.  Go to step 4. Repeat until you run out of time or list items.\n\nIn FVP, then, you perform a series of pairwise comparisons between tasks, in each case asking whether the new task is something you *want to do more than* the old task. The “want to do more than” comparison is deliberately vague: Depending on context, it might be the thing that would best move your project forward, the thing that would have the worst consequences if you didn’t do it, or the thing you would most enjoy doing.

Much of it involved rewriting the original work of others, such as Anna Salamon, Kenzie Ashkie, Val Smith, Dan Keys, and other influential CFAR founders and staff, but the actual content was filtered through me as single author as part of getting everything into a consistent and coherent shape.\n\nI have mild intentions to update it in the future with a handful of other new chapters that were on the list, but which didn't get written before CFAR let me go. Note that such updates will likely not be current-CFAR-approved, but will still derive directly from my understanding of the curriculum as former Curriculum Director."

      "markdown": "[Newcomb's Problem](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Newcomb%27s_problem) is effectively a problem about pre-commitment. Everyone agrees that if you have the opportunity to pre-commit in advance of Omega predicting you, then you ought to. The only question is what you ought to do if you either failed to do this or weren't given the opportunity to do this. LW-Style Decision Theories like [TDT](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Timeless_decision_theory) or [UDT](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory) say that you should act as though you are pre-committed, while [Casual Decision Theory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Causal_Decision_Theory) says that it's too late.\n\n(I've written about Newcomb's Problem and pre-commitment [before](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s), but I don't feel that I quite did the topic justice. I'm also hugely in favour of short, definitive articles on specific points that can serve as a quick reference. So here we go:)\n\nFormal pre-commitments include things like rewriting your code, signing a legally binding contract or providing assets as security. If set up correctly, they ensure that a rational agent actually keeps their end of the bargain. Of course, an irrational agent may still break their end of the bargain.\n\nEffective pre-commitment describes any situation where an agent must (in the logical sense) necessarily perform an action in the future, even if there is no formal pre-commitment. If libertarian freewill were to exist, then no-one would ever be effectively pre-committed, but if the universe is deterministic, then we are effectively pre-committed to any choice that we make (quantum mechanics effectively pre-commits us to particular probability distributions, rather than individual choices, but for purposes of simplicity we will ignore this here and just assume straightforward determinism). This follows straight from the definition of determinism (more discussion about the philosophical consequences of determinism in a [previous post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YpdTSt4kRnuSkn63c/the-prediction-problem-a-variant-on-newcomb-s)).\n\nOne reason why this concept seems so weird is that there's absolutely no need for an agent that's effectively pre-committed to know that it is pre-committed until the exact moment when it locks in its decision. From the agent's perspective, it magically turns out to be pre-committed to whatever action it chooses, however, the truth is that the agent was always pre-committed to this action, just without knowing.\n\nMuch of the confusion about pre-commitment is about whether we should be looking at formal or effective pre-commitment. Perfect predictors only care about effective pre-commitment; for them formalities are unnecessary and possibly misleading. However, human level agents tend to care much more about formal pre-commitments. Some people, like detectives or poker players, may be really good at reading people, but they're still nothing compared to a perfect predictor and most people aren't even this good. So in everyday life, we tend to care much more about formal pre-commitments when we want certainty.\n\nHowever, Newcomb's Problem explicitly specifies a perfect predictor, so we shouldn't be thinking about human level predictors. In fact, I'd say that some of the emphasise on formal pre-commitment comes from anthropomorphising perfect predictors. It's really hard for us to accept that anyone or anything could actually be that good and that there's no way to get ahead of it.\n\nIn closing, differentiating the two kinds of pre-commitment really clarifies these kinds of discussions. We may not be able to go back into the past and pre-commit to a certain cause of action, but we can take an action on the basis that it would be good if we had pre-committed to it and be assured that we will discover that we were actually pre-committed to it.\n\n(Happy to rename these concepts if anyone has better names)"

It ignores the other lessons that such a discussion may teach us and how it might have logical consequences for situations that actually do occur.</p><p>(<strong>Note: </strong>This post was renamed from: Unrealistic Hypotheticals Still Contain Lessons)</p><p><strong id=\"Exploiting_Opportunities_for_Learning\">Exploiting Opportunities for Learning</strong></p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/neQ7eXuaXpiYw7SBy/the-least-convenient-possible-world\">The Least Convenient Possible World</a>, Scott Alexander considers the classic objection to utilitarianism that it implies that a surgeon should be prepared to harvest the organs of a random traveller if it would allow them to save five other patients. Scott argues that pointing out that the random traveller's organs probably be genetic mismatches, while \"technically correct\", also \"completely misses the point and loses a valuable opportunity to examine the nature of morality\". He also notes that responding in this manner leaves too much \"wiggle room\". Even if we aren't consciously aware of it, we often construct arguments to avoid believing things that we don't want to, so we can improve our rationality by limiting our ability to avoid understanding the other person's perspective. While Scott is referring to people who completely miss the point of the hypothetical, I think that dismissing a hypothetical as unrealistic often also sacrifices opportunities for learning as we'll see below.</p><p><strong id=\"Practise_Exercises_Don_t_Need_to_be_Real\">Practise Exercises Don't Need to be Real</strong></p><p>Imagine that you are an instructor setting problems for your students so that they can learn an area like economics, physics or applied maths. How strongly do you care about these exercises being realistic? I would argue that this isn't very important and that this further applies to philosophy:</p><p>1. Simplification: Students may be at a point where a realistic exercise would be quite beyond their abilities. Imagine that you are trying to teach your students how to calculate falling objects. One student complains that you are ignoring air resistance. You try to explain that you can talk about air resistance after you've covered the basics, but they insist that any discussion without air resistance is utterly pointless. Eventually you concede, but most of the class ends up failing the quiz the next week because they weren't ready for the harder problems. Similarly, philosophical problems often assume \"no-one will ever know\" so that you can discuss moral principles without 90% of the time going into arguing about human psychology and sociology which had nothing to do with the point you were trying to illustrate.</p><p>2. Testing for Understanding: Students are often assigned questions as a way to gauge their understanding of a concept. Maybe no object has zero mass, but if someone can't tell you that this should create no gravitational force, they must have a misunderstanding somewhere. Maybe you could ask about an object that weighs 0.01 grams instead, but then they'd have to pull out a calculator. Similarly, even if utility monsters don't exist, they provide a useful tool for clarifying utilitarianism, as it explains why, \"greatest good for the greatest number\" isn't a completely accurate characterisation. And indeed, there's no reason why some people or organisms mightn't generally experience more utility than others.</p><p>3. Realism Trades off Against Other Factors: Perhaps, you could find simple exercises that are realistic or test for understanding with more realistic scenarios. However, your goal is to make your students learn and this is dependent on a whole host of factors. If you insist on questions always being realistic, then this trades off against other dimensions, such as engagement, memorability and time required to construct a situation. This last dimension is particularly important for conversations where people have to be able to construct these situations on the fly.</p><p>This is taken for granted when talking about maths and physics, but if you want to learn to deeply understand philosophy, you'll have to accept unrealistic practise questions as well.</p><p><strong id=\"Applying_the_Unrealistic_to_the_Real\">Applying the Unrealistic to the Real</strong></p><p>In maths, it is very common to take the limit of a formula as some variable, like as x approaches infinity. This technique is very useful for approximations. For example, it's easier to consider the limit as x approaches infinity of (2x^2-x+10)/(x^2+79) than to substitute in a specific value like a million. This is applied constantly throughout programming with <a href=\"https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/\">Big-O Notation</a>. Even though an infinite dataset is completely unrealistic, this heuristic is still incredibly useful for designing algorithms.</p><p>Similarly, when a utilitarian points out that strict versions of deontology will always allow us to construct situations where following the rules cost us infinite utility, the unrealism of the situation doesn't make it irrelevant. Just with Big-O Notation, step 2 of the argument could very well be to scale it down to a more realistic situation. Unfortunately, many people will assume that step 2 isn't coming and judge the argument as flawed at this stage. They may even interrupt the speaker with the objection that the argument isn't realistic. This often negatively affects the conversation, as it pushes the speaker to address step 2, before they've had the opportunity to ensure that everyone has understood step 1.</p><p><strong id=\"Being_Aware_of_Limitations\">Being Aware of Limitations</strong></p><p>Consider the formula y=10/(x[x-5]). This has two discontinuities at x=0 and x=5.  I really want a more practical example, so if you have one, please list in the comment, but let's pretend x represents the number of people and we know there'll always be at least one person in practise. So someone could easily wave away the discontinuity with the x=0 case and completely miss the second one. But if rationality is winning, this isn't it. If they instead looked into it, they'd have realised that more general issue is the division by zero and not overlooked this issue. Yet it is very easy for the person getting it wrong to convince themselves that it is the person trying to figure out the situation with x=0 who is irrational.</p><p>Let's suppose that someone is promoting deontology and they aren't worried about theoretical situations. They just want a practical model or heuristic to help them act morality. If they are proposing a heuristic, they should fully expect it to have limitations and situations where it just completely breaks. And it would probably be useful to know what these limitations are. Some of these limitations mightn't be obvious and the heuristic may even be broken if some of these occur more often than they expect. Discussions of how the model behaves as the utility cost of a principle approaches infinity shouldn't be met by dismissal, but by either biting the bullet or acknowledging that the model seems to break down in those circumstances. It can still be defended as a heuristic or you can assert this kind of situation tends to break our intuitions (see <a href=\"http://archive.is/NIGNx\">epistemic learned helplessness</a>), but either way it needs to be acknowledged as a limitation that can be weighed up against other limitations. After all, there could be a better model that has a solution to these issues.</p><p><strong id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</strong></p><p>One of the key threads of this post has been to not assume that you know where an argument is going. Just because someone is talking about an unrealistic situation, it doesn't follow that they aren't going to tie it back to reality. Further, you shouldn't assume that there's a single path for this to occur. At the very least, I would suggest replacing \"This is unrealistic\" with \"How are you going to tie it back to reality?\". The second question is far superior, as it doesn't make the unwarranted assumption that the only purpose of constructing a model is to attempt to directly apply it to reality.</p>",

class=\"MsoNormal\">It commonly acknowledged here that current decision theories have deficiencies that show up in the form of various paradoxes. Since there seems to be little hope that Eliezer will publish his <a href=\"/lw/135/timeless_decision_theory_problems_i_cant_solve/\">Timeless Decision Theory</a> any time soon, I decided to try to synthesize some of the ideas discussed in this forum, along with a few of my own, into a coherent alternative that is hopefully not so paradox-prone.</p>\n<p>I'll start with a way of framing the question. Put yourself in the place of an AI, or more specifically, the decision algorithm of an AI. You have access to your own source code S, plus a bit string X representing all of your memories and sensory data. You have to choose an output string Y. That’s the decision. The question is, how? (The answer isn't “Run S,” because what we want to know is what S should be in the first place.)</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let’s proceed by asking the question, “What are the consequences of S, on input X, returning Y as the output, instead of Z?” To begin with, we'll consider just the consequences of that choice in the realm of abstract computations (i.e. computations considered as mathematical objects rather than as implemented in physical systems). The most immediate consequence is that any program that calls S as a subroutine with X as input, will receive Y as output, instead of Z. What happens next is a bit harder to tell, but supposing that you know something about a program P that call S as a subroutine, you can further deduce the effects of choosing Y versus Z by tracing the difference between the two choices in P’s subsequent execution. We could call these the computational consequences of Y. Suppose you have preferences about the execution of a set of programs, some of which call S as a subroutine, then you can satisfy your preferences directly by choosing the output of S so that those programs will run the way you most prefer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a id=\"more\"></a>A more general class of consequences might be called logical consequences. Consider a program P’ that doesn’t call S, but a different subroutine S’ that’s logically equivalent to S. In other words, S’ always produces the same output as S when given the same input. Due to the logical relationship between S and S’, your choice of output for S must also affect the subsequent execution of P’. Another example of a logical relationship is an S' which always returns the first bit of the output of S when given the same input, or one that returns the same output as S on some subset of inputs.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In general, you can’t be certain about the consequences of a choice, because you’re not logically omniscient. How to handle logical/mathematical uncertainty is an <a href=\"/lw/f9/a_request_for_open_problems/bun\">open problem</a>, so for now we'll just assume that you have access to a \"mathematical intuition subroutine\" that somehow allows you to form beliefs about the likely consequences of your choices.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At this point, you might ask, “That’s well and good, but what if my preferences extend beyond abstract computations? What about consequences on the physical universe?” The answer is, we can view the physical universe as a program that runs S as a subroutine, or more generally, view it as a mathematical object which has S embedded within it. (From now on I’ll just refer to programs for simplicity, with the understanding that the subsequent discussion can be generalized to non-computable universes.) Your preferences about the physical universe can be translated into preferences about such a program P and programmed into the AI. The AI, upon receiving an input X, will look into P, determine all the instances where it calls S with input X, and choose the output that optimizes its preferences about the execution of P. If the preferences were translated faithfully, the the AI's decision should also optimize your preferences regarding the physical universe. This faithful translation is a second major open problem.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What if you have some uncertainty about which program our universe corresponds to? In that case, we have to specify preferences for the entire set of programs that our universe may correspond to. If your preferences for what happens in one such program is independent of what happens in another, then we can represent them by a probability distribution on the set of programs plus a utility function on the execution of each individual program. More generally, we can always represent your preferences as a utility function on vectors of the form &lt;E1, E2, E3, …&gt; where E1 is an execution history of P1, E2 is an execution history of P2, and so on.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These considerations lead to the following design for the decision algorithm S. S is coded with a vector &lt;P1, P2, P3, ...&gt; of programs that it cares about, and a utility function on vectors of the form &lt;E1, E2, E3, …&gt; that defines its preferences on how those programs should run. When it receives an input X, it looks inside the programs P1, P2, P3, ..., and uses its \"mathematical intuition\" to form a probability distribution P_Y over the set of vectors &lt;E1, E2, E3, …&gt; for each choice of output string Y. Finally, it outputs a string Y* that maximizes the expected utility Sum P_Y(&lt;E1, E2, E3, …&gt;) U(&lt;E1, E2, E3, …&gt;). (This specifically assumes that expected utility maximization is the right way to deal with mathematical uncertainty. Consider it a temporary placeholder until that problem is solved. Also, I'm describing the algorithm as a brute force search for simplicity. In reality, you'd probably want it to do something cleverer to find the optimal Y* more quickly.)</p>\n<h4 id=\"Example_1__Counterfactual_Mugging\">Example 1: Counterfactual Mugging</h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Note that Bayesian updating is not done explicitly in this decision theory. When the decision algorithm receives input X, it may determine that a subset of programs it has preferences about never calls it with X and are also logically independent of its output, and therefore it can safely ignore them when computing the consequences of a choice. There is no need to set the probabilities of those programs to 0 and renormalize.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, with that in mind, we can model <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging\">Counterfactual Mugging</a> by the following Python program:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">def P(coin):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI_balance = 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if coin == \"heads\":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if S(\"heads\") == \"give $100\":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI_balance -= 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if coin == \"tails\":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Omega_Predict(S, \"heads\") == \"give $100\":<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AI_balance += 10000</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The AI’s goal is to maximize expected utility = .5 * U(AI_balance after P(\"heads\")) + .5 * U(AI_balance after P(\"tails\")). Assuming U(AI_balance)=AI_balance, it’s easy to determine U(AI_balance after P(\"heads\")) as a function of S’s output. It equals 0 if S(“heads”) == “give $100”, and 100 otherwise. To compute U(AI_balance after P(\"tails\")), the AI needs to look inside the Omega_Predict function (not shown here), and try to figure out how accurate it is. Assuming the mathematical intuition module says that choosing “give $100” as the output for S(“heads”) makes it more likely (by a sufficiently large margin) for Omega_Predict(S, \"heads\") to output “give $100”, then that choice maximizes expected utility.</p>\n<h4 class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"Example_2__Return_of_Bayes\">Example 2: Return of Bayes<br></h4>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This example is based on case 1 in Eliezer's post <a href=\"/lw/hk/priors_as_mathematical_objects/\">Priors as Mathematical Objects</a>. An urn contains 5 red balls and 5 white balls. The AI is asked to predict the probability of each ball being red as it as drawn from the urn, its goal being to maximize the expected logarithmic score of its predictions. The main point of this example is that this decision theory can reproduce the effect of Bayesian reasoning when the situation calls for it. We can model the scenario using preferences on the following Python program:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">def P(n):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urn = ['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white']<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; history = []<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; score = 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while urn:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i = n%len(urn)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n/len(urn)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ball = urn[i]<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; urn[i:i+1] = []<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prediction = S(history)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ball == 'red':<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; score += math.log(prediction, 2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; score += math.log(1-prediction, 2)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print (score, ball, prediction)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; history.append(ball)</p>\n<p>Here is a printout from a sample run, using n=1222222:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-1.0 red 0.5<br>-2.16992500144 red 0.444444444444<br>-2.84799690655 white 0.375<br>-3.65535182861 white 0.428571428571<br>-4.65535182861 red 0.5<br>-5.9772799235 red 0.4<br>-7.9772799235 red 0.25<br>-7.9772799235 white 0.0<br>-7.9772799235 white 0.0<br>-7.9772799235 white 0.0</p>\n<p>S should use deductive reasoning to conclude that returning (number of red balls remaining / total balls remaining) maximizes the average score across the range of possible inputs to P, from n=1 to 10! (representing the possible orders in which the balls are drawn), and do that. Alternatively, S can approximate the correct predictions using brute force: generate a random function from histories to predictions, and compute what the average score would be if it were to implement that function. Repeat this a large number of times and it is likely to find a function that returns values close to the optimum predictions.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Example_3__Level_IV_Multiverse\">Example 3: Level IV Multiverse</h4>\n<p>In Tegmark's Level 4 <a href=\"http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html\">Multiverse</a>, all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically. In this case, we'd need to program the AI with preferences over all mathematical structures, perhaps represented by an ordering or utility function over conjunctions of well-formed sentences in a formal set theory. The AI will then proceed to \"optimize\" all of mathematics, or at least the parts of math that (A) are logically dependent on its decisions and (B) it can reason or form intuitions about.</p>\n<p>I suggest that the Level 4 Multiverse should be considered the default setting for a general decision theory, since we cannot rule out the possibility that all mathematical structures do indeed exist physically, or that we have direct preferences on mathematical structures (in which case there is no need for them to exist \"physically\"). Clearly, application of decision theory to the Level 4 Multiverse requires that the previously mentioned open problems be solved in their most general forms: how to handle logical uncertainty in any mathematical domain, and how to map fuzzy human preferences to well-defined preferences over the structures of mathematical objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Added:</strong> For further information and additional posts on this decision theory idea, which came to be called \"Updateless Decision Theory\", please see <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory\">its entry</a>&nbsp;in the LessWrong Wiki.</p>",

      "markdown": "It commonly acknowledged here that current decision theories have deficiencies that show up in the form of various paradoxes. Since there seems to be little hope that Eliezer will publish his [Timeless Decision Theory](/lw/135/timeless_decision_theory_problems_i_cant_solve/) any time soon, I decided to try to synthesize some of the ideas discussed in this forum, along with a few of my own, into a coherent alternative that is hopefully not so paradox-prone.\n\nI'll start with a way of framing the question. Put yourself in the place of an AI, or more specifically, the decision algorithm of an AI. You have access to your own source code S, plus a bit string X representing all of your memories and sensory data. You have to choose an output string Y. That’s the decision. The question is, how? (The answer isn't “Run S,” because what we want to know is what S should be in the first place.)\n\nLet’s proceed by asking the question, “What are the consequences of S, on input X, returning Y as the output, instead of Z?” To begin with, we'll consider just the consequences of that choice in the realm of abstract computations (i.e. computations considered as mathematical objects rather than as implemented in physical systems). The most immediate consequence is that any program that calls S as a subroutine with X as input, will receive Y as output, instead of Z. What happens next is a bit harder to tell, but supposing that you know something about a program P that call S as a subroutine, you can further deduce the effects of choosing Y versus Z by tracing the difference between the two choices in P’s subsequent execution. We could call these the computational consequences of Y. Suppose you have preferences about the execution of a set of programs, some of which call S as a subroutine, then you can satisfy your preferences directly by choosing the output of S so that those programs will run the way you most prefer.\n\nA more general class of consequences might be called logical consequences. Consider a program P’ that doesn’t call S, but a different subroutine S’ that’s logically equivalent to S. In other words, S’ always produces the same output as S when given the same input. Due to the logical relationship between S and S’, your choice of output for S must also affect the subsequent execution of P’. Another example of a logical relationship is an S' which always returns the first bit of the output of S when given the same input, or one that returns the same output as S on some subset of inputs.\n\nIn general, you can’t be certain about the consequences of a choice, because you’re not logically omniscient. How to handle logical/mathematical uncertainty is an [open problem](/lw/f9/a_request_for_open_problems/bun), so for now we'll just assume that you have access to a \"mathematical intuition subroutine\" that somehow allows you to form beliefs about the likely consequences of your choices.\n\nAt this point, you might ask, “That’s well and good, but what if my preferences extend beyond abstract computations? What about consequences on the physical universe?” The answer is, we can view the physical universe as a program that runs S as a subroutine, or more generally, view it as a mathematical object which has S embedded within it. (From now on I’ll just refer to programs for simplicity, with the understanding that the subsequent discussion can be generalized to non-computable universes.) Your preferences about the physical universe can be translated into preferences about such a program P and programmed into the AI. The AI, upon receiving an input X, will look into P, determine all the instances where it calls S with input X, and choose the output that optimizes its preferences about the execution of P. If the preferences were translated faithfully, the the AI's decision should also optimize your preferences regarding the physical universe. This faithful translation is a second major open problem.\n\nWhat if you have some uncertainty about which program our universe corresponds to? In that case, we have to specify preferences for the entire set of programs that our universe may correspond to. If your preferences for what happens in one such program is independent of what happens in another, then we can represent them by a probability distribution on the set of programs plus a utility function on the execution of each individual program. More generally, we can always represent your preferences as a utility function on vectors of the form <E1, E2, E3, …> where E1 is an execution history of P1, E2 is an execution history of P2, and so on.\n\nThese considerations lead to the following design for the decision algorithm S. S is coded with a vector <P1, P2, P3, ...> of programs that it cares about, and a utility function on vectors of the form <E1, E2, E3, …> that defines its preferences on how those programs should run. When it receives an input X, it looks inside the programs P1, P2, P3, ..., and uses its \"mathematical intuition\" to form a probability distribution P\\_Y over the set of vectors <E1, E2, E3, …> for each choice of output string Y. Finally, it outputs a string Y* that maximizes the expected utility Sum P\\_Y(<E1, E2, E3, …>) U(<E1, E2, E3, …>). (This specifically assumes that expected utility maximization is the right way to deal with mathematical uncertainty. Consider it a temporary placeholder until that problem is solved. Also, I'm describing the algorithm as a brute force search for simplicity. In reality, you'd probably want it to do something cleverer to find the optimal Y* more quickly.)\n\n#### Example 1: Counterfactual Mugging\n\nNote that Bayesian updating is not done explicitly in this decision theory. When the decision algorithm receives input X, it may determine that a subset of programs it has preferences about never calls it with X and are also logically independent of its output, and therefore it can safely ignore them when computing the consequences of a choice. There is no need to set the probabilities of those programs to 0 and renormalize.\n\nSo, with that in mind, we can model [Counterfactual Mugging](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging) by the following Python program:\n\ndef P(coin):  \n    AI_balance = 100  \n    if coin == \"heads\":  \n        if S(\"heads\") == \"give $100\":  \n            AI_balance -= 100  \n    if coin == \"tails\":  \n        if Omega_Predict(S, \"heads\") == \"give $100\":  \n            AI_balance += 10000\n\nThe AI’s goal is to maximize expected utility = .5 * U(AI\\_balance after P(\"heads\")) + .5 * U(AI\\_balance after P(\"tails\")). Assuming U(AI\\_balance)=AI\\_balance, it’s easy to determine U(AI\\_balance after P(\"heads\")) as a function of S’s output. It equals 0 if S(“heads”) == “give $100”, and 100 otherwise. To compute U(AI\\_balance after P(\"tails\")), the AI needs to look inside the Omega\\_Predict function (not shown here), and try to figure out how accurate it is. Assuming the mathematical intuition module says that choosing “give $100” as the output for S(“heads”) makes it more likely (by a sufficiently large margin) for Omega\\_Predict(S, \"heads\") to output “give $100”, then that choice maximizes expected utility.\n\n#### Example 2: Return of Bayes  \n\nThis example is based on case 1 in Eliezer's post [Priors as Mathematical Objects](/lw/hk/priors_as_mathematical_objects/). An urn contains 5 red balls and 5 white balls. The AI is asked to predict the probability of each ball being red as it as drawn from the urn, its goal being to maximize the expected logarithmic score of its predictions. The main point of this example is that this decision theory can reproduce the effect of Bayesian reasoning when the situation calls for it. We can model the scenario using preferences on the following Python program:\n\ndef P(n):  \n    urn = \\['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white', 'white'\\]  \n    history = \\[\\]  \n    score = 0  \n    while urn:  \n        i = n%len(urn)  \n        n = n/len(urn)  \n        ball = urn\\[i\\]  \n        urn\\[i:i+1\\] = \\[\\]  \n        prediction = S(history)  \n        if ball == 'red':  \n            score += math.log(prediction, 2)  \n        else:  \n            score += math.log(1-prediction, 2)  \n        print (score, ball, prediction)  \n        history.append(ball)\n\nHere is a printout from a sample run, using n=1222222:\n\n-1.0 red 0.5  \n-2.16992500144 red 0.444444444444  \n-2.84799690655 white 0.375  \n-3.65535182861 white 0.428571428571  \n-4.65535182861 red 0.5  \n-5.9772799235 red 0.4  \n-7.9772799235 red 0.25  \n-7.9772799235 white 0.0  \n-7.9772799235 white 0.0  \n-7.9772799235 white 0.0\n\nS should use deductive reasoning to conclude that returning (number of red balls remaining / total balls remaining) maximizes the average score across the range of possible inputs to P, from n=1 to 10! (representing the possible orders in which the balls are drawn), and do that. Alternatively, S can approximate the correct predictions using brute force: generate a random function from histories to predictions, and compute what the average score would be if it were to implement that function. Repeat this a large number of times and it is likely to find a function that returns values close to the optimum predictions.\n\n#### Example 3: Level IV Multiverse\n\nIn Tegmark's Level 4 [Multiverse](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/multiverse.html), all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically. In this case, we'd need to program the AI with preferences over all mathematical structures, perhaps represented by an ordering or utility function over conjunctions of well-formed sentences in a formal set theory. The AI will then proceed to \"optimize\" all of mathematics, or at least the parts of math that (A) are logically dependent on its decisions and (B) it can reason or form intuitions about.\n\nI suggest that the Level 4 Multiverse should be considered the default setting for a general decision theory, since we cannot rule out the possibility that all mathematical structures do indeed exist physically, or that we have direct preferences on mathematical structures (in which case there is no need for them to exist \"physically\"). Clearly, application of decision theory to the Level 4 Multiverse requires that the previously mentioned open problems be solved in their most general forms: how to handle logical uncertainty in any mathematical domain, and how to map fuzzy human preferences to well-defined preferences over the structures of mathematical objects.\n\n**Added:** For further information and additional posts on this decision theory idea, which came to be called \"Updateless Decision Theory\", please see [its entry](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Updateless_decision_theory) in the LessWrong Wiki."

The post compares the\ndecision theories along outermost iteration (action vs policy vs algorithm),\nupdatelessness (updateless or updateful), and type of counterfactual used\n(causal, conditional, logical). It then explains the decision theories in more\ndetail, in particular giving an expected utility formula for each.

However, the\nnature (type) of these “options” differs among the various theories.\nMost decision theories iterate through either <em>actions</em> or <em>policies</em>.\nWhen a decision theory iterates through actions (to find the best action),\nit is doing “action selection”, and the decision theory outputs a single action.\nWhen a decision theory iterates through policies (to find the best policy),\nit is doing “policy selection”, and outputs a single <em>policy</em>, which is an\nobservation-to-action mapping. To get an action out of a decision theory\nthat does policy selection (because what we really care about is knowing which\naction to take), we must <em>call</em> the policy on the actual observation.</p>\n<p>Using the notation of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf\">FDT paper</a>,\nan action has type <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathcal A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-cal-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

If it doesn’t update on the observation, it is\n<em>updateless</em>.</p>\n<p>This idea is similar to how in Rawls’s “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">veil of ignorance</a>”, you must pick your\nmoral principles, societal policies, etc., before you find out who\nyou are in the world or as if you don’t know who you are in the world.</p>\n<p>How can you tell if a decision theory is\nupdateless? In its expected utility formula, if it conditions\non the observation, it is updateful.

I won’t define the notation very clearly, since I\nam mostly collecting the various notations that have been used (so that you can\nlook at the linked sources for the details). My goals are to explain how to fill\nin the table above and to show how all the existing variants in notation are\nsaying the same thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"UDT1_and_FDT__iterate_over_actions_\">UDT1 and FDT (iterate over actions)</h2>\n<p>I will describe UDT1 and FDT’s action variant together, because I think they\ngive the same decisions (if there’s a decision problem where they differ, I would like to know about it). The main differences between the two seem to be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The way they are formalized, where FDT uses graphical models and UDT1 uses some kind of non-graphical “mathematical intuition module”.</li>\n<li>The naming, where UDT1 emphasizes the “updateless” aspect and FDT emphasizes the logical counterfactual aspect.</li>\n<li>Some additional assumptions that UDT has that FDT doesn’t. Rob Bensinger <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9BYo6Q9qBMXWLjqPS/miri-decisions-are-for-making-bad-outcomes-inconsistent#JJBt6eitzzrWPukSp\">says</a> “accepting FDT doesn’t necessarily require a commitment to some of the philosophical ideas associated with updatelessness and logical prior probability that MIRI, Wei Dai, or other FDT proponents happen to accept” and also <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/#comment-3581691194\">says</a> UDT “built in some debatable assumptions (over and above what’s needed to show why TDT, CDT, and EDT don’t work)”. I’m not sure what these additional assumptions are, but my guess is it has to do with viewing the world as a program, Tegmark’s level IV multiverse, and things like that (I would be interested in hearing more about the exact assumptions).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/\">original UDT post</a>, the expected utility formula is written like this:\n<span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"Y^* = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{Y} \\sum P_Y(\\langle E_1,E_2,E_3,\\ldots\\rangle) U(\\langle E_1,E_2,E_3,\\ldots\\rangle)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.182em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

The <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/updateless_dt/\">Updateless decision theories</a> page on Arbital calls TDT “updateful”. <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf\">Hintze</a> (p. 11): “TDP’s failure on the Curious Benefactor is straightforward.

      "markdown": "# Introduction\n\n## Summary\n\nThis post is a comparison of various existing decision theories, with a focus\non decision theories that use logical counterfactuals (a.k.a. the kind of decision theories most discussed on LessWrong). The post compares the\ndecision theories along outermost iteration (action vs policy vs algorithm),\nupdatelessness (updateless or updateful), and type of counterfactual used\n(causal, conditional, logical). It then explains the decision theories in more\ndetail, in particular giving an expected utility formula for each. The post then gives\nexamples of specific existing decision problems where the decision theories\ngive different answers.\n\n## Value-added\n\nThere are some other comparisons of decision theories (see the “Other comparisons” section),\nbut they either (1)\ndon’t focus on logical-counterfactual decision theories; or (2) are outdated\n(written before the new functional/logical decision theory terminology came about).\n\nTo give a more personal motivation, after reading through a bunch of papers and posts about these\ndecision theories, and feeling like I understood the basic ideas, I\nremained highly confused about basic things like “How is UDT different from\nFDT?”, “Why was TDT deprecated?”, and “If TDT performs worse than FDT, then\nwhat’s one decision problem where they give different outputs?”\nThis post hopes to clarify these and other questions.\n\nNone of the decision theory material in this post is novel. I am still learning\nthe basics myself, and I would appreciate any corrections (even about subtle/nitpicky stuff).\n\n## Audience\n\nThis post is intended for [people](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/#comment-3581536881) [who](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/cAMhvPgMQJzhrpNdN/publication-of-anthropic-decision-theory/comment/zz7GRTsvG8gD8EDxH) [are](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/9BYo6Q9qBMXWLjqPS/miri-decisions-are-for-making-bad-outcomes-inconsistent/comment/i2xAQFjo2odYW2uXz) [similarly](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/xJRPWBfJQcbWaoCLp/making-equilibrium-cdt-into-fdt-in-one-easy-step/comment/n7auEbvrH5DoC6Tvt) [confused](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2THFt7BChfCgwYDeA/let-s-discuss-functional-decision-theory) [about](http://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/168759631049/the-new-decision-theory-paper-exists-because-the) the\ndifferences between TDT, UDT, FDT, and LDT. In terms of reader background assumed,\nit would be good to know the statements to some standard decision theory\nproblems (Newcomb’s problem, smoking lesion, Parfit’s hitchhiker, transparent\nbox Newcomb’s problem, counterfactual mugging (a.k.a. [curious benefactor](https://philpapers.org/archive/BARWDT-3.pdf); see page 56, footnote 89)) and the “correct” answers to\nthem, and having enough background in math to understand the expected utility\nformulas.\n\nIf you don’t have the background, I would recommend reading\nchapters 5 and 6 of\nGary Drescher’s [*Good and Real*](https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/decision/2006-drescher-goodandreal.pdf) (explains well the idea of subjunctive means–end relations),\nthe [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) (explains well how FDT’s action selection variant works, and how FDT differs from CDT and EDT),\n[“Cheating Death in Damascus”](https://intelligence.org/files/DeathInDamascus.pdf), and\n[“Toward Idealized Decision Theory”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01986.pdf) (explains the difference between policy selection and logical counterfactuals well), and understanding\nwhat Wei Dai calls “decision theoretic thinking” (see comments:\n[1](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8xh9R7RaNitKtkaa/explicit-optimization-of-global-strategy-fixing-a-bug-in#FMvBDD7fNQSd3B3qd),\n[2](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gkAecqbuPw4iggiub/common-mistakes-people-make-when-thinking-about-decision#uXrbGTefqvek9kkzf),\n[3](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GfHdNfqxe3cSCfpHL/the-absent-minded-driver#Hrtu69eAh86KFNgBC)).\nI think a lot of (especially old) content on decision theory is confusingly\nwritten or unfriendly to beginners, and would recommend skipping around to find\nexplanations that “click”.\n\n# Comparison dimensions\n\nMy main motivation is to try to distinguish between TDT, UDT, and FDT, so I\nfocus on three dimensions for comparison that I think best display the differences\nbetween these decision theories.\n\n## Outermost iteration\n\nAll of the decision theories in this post iterate through some set of “options” (intentionally vague)\nat the outermost layer of execution to find the best “option”. However, the\nnature (type) of these “options” differs among the various theories.\nMost decision theories iterate through either *actions* or *policies*.\nWhen a decision theory iterates through actions (to find the best action),\nit is doing “action selection”, and the decision theory outputs a single action.\nWhen a decision theory iterates through policies (to find the best policy),\nit is doing “policy selection”, and outputs a single *policy*, which is an\nobservation-to-action mapping. To get an action out of a decision theory\nthat does policy selection (because what we really care about is knowing which\naction to take), we must *call* the policy on the actual observation.\n\nUsing the notation of the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf),\nan action has type $\\mathcal A$ while a policy has type $\\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal A$,\nwhere $\\mathcal X$ is the set of observations.\nSo given a policy $\\pi : \\mathcal X \\to \\mathcal A$ and observation $x \\in \\mathcal X$,\nwe get the action by calling $\\pi$ on $x$, i.e. $\\pi(x) \\in \\mathcal A$.\n\nFrom the expected utility formula of the decision theory,\nyou can tell action vs policy selection by seeing what variable comes beneath\nthe $\\operatorname{arg\\,max}$ operator (the $\\operatorname{arg\\,max}$ operator is what does the outermost iteration); if it is $a\\in\\mathcal A$ (or similar) then it is iterating over actions, and if it is $\\pi \\in \\Pi$ (or similar), then it is iterating over policies.\n\nOne exception to the above is UDT2, which seems to iterate over *algorithms*.\n\n## Updatelessness\n\nIn some decision problems, the agent makes an observation, and has the choice\nof updating on this observation before acting. Two examples of this are: in\ncounterfactual mugging (a.k.a. curious benefactor), where the agent makes the observation that the coin has\ncome up tails; and in the transparent box Newcomb’s problem, where the agent\nsees whether the big box is full or empty.\n\nIf the decision algorithm updates on the observation, it is *updateful* (a.k.a.\n“not updateless”). If it doesn’t update on the observation, it is\n*updateless*.\n\nThis idea is similar to how in Rawls’s “[veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance)”, you must pick your\nmoral principles, societal policies, etc., before you find out who\nyou are in the world or as if you don’t know who you are in the world.\n\nHow can you tell if a decision theory is\nupdateless? In its expected utility formula, if it conditions\non the observation, it is updateful. In this case\nthe probability factor looks like\n$P(\\ldots\\mid \\ldots, \\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x)$,\nwhere $x$ is the observation (sometimes the observation is called “sense data” and is denoted by $s$).\nIf a decision theory is updateless, the conditioning on\n“$\\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x$” is absent.\nUpdatelessness only makes a difference in decision problems that\nhave observations.\n\nThere seem to be different meanings of “updateless” in use. In this post I will\nuse the above meaning. (I will try to post a question on LessWrong soon about these\ndifferent meanings.)\n\n## Type of counterfactual\n\nIn the course of reasoning about a decision problem, the agent\ncan construct counterfactuals or hypotheticals like “if I do *this*,\nthen *that* happens”. There are several different kinds of counterfactuals,\nand decision theories are divided among them.\n\nThe three types of counterfactuals that will concern us are: causal, conditional/evidential, and logical/subjunctive.\nThe distinctions between these are explained clearly in the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf)\nso I recommend reading that (and I won’t explain them here).\n\nIn the expected utility formula, if the probability factor\nlooks like\n$P(\\ldots\\mid\\ldots, \\mathrm{A \\small CT}=a)$ then it is evidential, and\nif it looks like $P(\\ldots \\mid \\ldots, \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a))$ then it is causal.\nI have seen the logical counterfactual written in many ways:\n\n* $P(\\ldots \\mid\\ldots, \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{\\small DT}(\\ldots)=\\ldots))$ e.g. in the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf), p. 14\n* $P(\\ldots \\mid\\ldots, \\mathtt{true}(\\mathrm{\\small DT}(\\ldots)=\\ldots))$ e.g. in the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf), p. 14\n* $P(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{\\small DT}(\\ldots)=\\ldots\\urcorner \\mathbin{\\Box\\kern-7mu\\rightarrow} \\ldots \\mid\\ldots)$ e.g. in [Hintze](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf), p. 4\n* $P(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{\\small DT}(\\ldots)=\\ldots\\urcorner \\triangleright \\ldots \\mid\\ldots)$ e.g. on [Arbital](https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5d6)\n\n## Other dimensions that I ignore\n\nThere are many more dimensions along which decision theories differ, but I\ndon’t understand these and they seem less relevant for comparing among the main\nlogical-counterfactual decision theories, so I will just list them here but\nwon’t go into them much later on in the post:\n\n* Reflective consistency (in particular [dynamic consistency](https://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf)): I think this is about whether an agent\n  would use precommitment mechanisms or self-modify to use a\n  different decision theory.  Can this be seen immediately from\n  the expected utility formula? If not, it might be unlike the\n  other three above. My current guess is that reflective consistency\n  is a higher-level property that follows from the above three.\n* Emphasis on graphical models: FDT is formalized using graphical models (of the kind you can read about in Judea Pearl’s book _Causality_) while UDT isn’t.\n* Recent developments like using logical inductors.\n* Uncertainty about where your decision algorithm is: I think this is some combination of the three that I’m already covering. For previous discussions, see [this section](http://acritch.com/deserving-trust/#grokking) of Andrew Critch’s post, [this comment](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Qyix5Z5YPSGYxf7GG/less-wrong-q-and-a-with-eliezer-yudkowsky-video-answers/comment/BrWSWrwaategHEkvh) by Wei Dai, and [this post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zztyZ4SKy7suZBpbk/another-attempt-to-explain-udt) by Vladimir Slepnev.\n* Different versions of UDT (e.g. proof-based, modal).\n\n# Comparison table along the given dimensions\n\nGiven the comparison dimensions above, the decision theories can be summarized as follows:\n\n|Decision theory|Outermost iteration|Updateless|Type of counterfactual|\n|--------------------------|------------|--------------|-------------|\n|Updateless decision theory 1 (UDT1)|action|yes|logical|\n|Updateless decision theory 1.1 (UDT1.1)|policy|yes|logical|\n|Updateless decision theory 2 (UDT2)|algorithm|yes|logical|\n|Functional decision theory, iterating over actions (FDT-action)|action|yes|logical|\n|Functional decision theory, iterating over policies (FDT-policy)|policy|yes|logical|\n|Logical decision theory (LDT)|unspecified|unspecified|logical|\n|Timeless decision theory (TDT)|action|no|logical|\n|Causal decision theory (CDT)|action|no|causal|\n|Evidential decision theory (EDT, “naive EDT”)|action|no|conditional|\n\nThe general “shape” of the expected utility formulas will be:\n\n$$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\color{blue}{\\text{outermost}\\\\ \\ \\text{iteration}}} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}=o_j \\mid \\color{red}{\\text{updatelessness}}, \\color{green}{\\text{counterfactual}})$$\n\nOr sometimes:\n\n$$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\color{blue}{\\text{outermost}\\\\ \\ \\text{iteration}}} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\color{green}{\\text{counterfactual}} \\mathbin{\\Box\\kern-7mu\\rightarrow} \\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}=o_j \\mid \\color{red}{\\text{updatelessness}})$$\n\n# Explanations of each decision theory\n\nThis section elaborates on the comparison above by giving an expected value\nformula for each decision theory and explaining why each cell in the table\ntakes that particular value. I won’t define the notation very clearly, since I\nam mostly collecting the various notations that have been used (so that you can\nlook at the linked sources for the details). My goals are to explain how to fill\nin the table above and to show how all the existing variants in notation are\nsaying the same thing.\n\n## UDT1 and FDT (iterate over actions)\n\nI will describe UDT1 and FDT’s action variant together, because I think they\ngive the same decisions (if there’s a decision problem where they differ, I would like to know about it). The main differences between the two seem to be:\n\n1. The way they are formalized, where FDT uses graphical models and UDT1 uses some kind of non-graphical “mathematical intuition module”.\n2. The naming, where UDT1 emphasizes the “updateless” aspect and FDT emphasizes the logical counterfactual aspect.\n3. Some additional assumptions that UDT has that FDT doesn’t. Rob Bensinger [says](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9BYo6Q9qBMXWLjqPS/miri-decisions-are-for-making-bad-outcomes-inconsistent#JJBt6eitzzrWPukSp) “accepting FDT doesn’t necessarily require a commitment to some of the philosophical ideas associated with updatelessness and logical prior probability that MIRI, Wei Dai, or other FDT proponents happen to accept” and also [says](https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/#comment-3581691194) UDT “built in some debatable assumptions (over and above what’s needed to show why TDT, CDT, and EDT don’t work)”. I’m not sure what these additional assumptions are, but my guess is it has to do with viewing the world as a program, Tegmark’s level IV multiverse, and things like that (I would be interested in hearing more about the exact assumptions).\n\nIn the [original UDT post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/), the expected utility formula is written like this:\n$$Y^* = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{Y} \\sum P_Y(\\langle E_1,E_2,E_3,\\ldots\\rangle) U(\\langle E_1,E_2,E_3,\\ldots\\rangle)$$\nHere $Y$ is an “output string” (which is basically an action). The sum is taken over all possible vectors of the execution histories.\nI prefer [Tyrrell McAllister’s notation](https://casparoesterheld.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/updateless_decision_theory-1.pdf):\n$$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{Y\\in \\mathbf Y} \\sum_{E\\in\\mathbf E} M(X,Y,E) U(E)$$\n\nTo explain the UDT1 row in the comparison table, note that:\n\n* The outermost iteration is $\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{Y\\in \\mathbf Y}$ (over output strings, a.k.a. actions), so it is doing action selection.\n* We don’t update on the observation. This isn’t really clear from the notation, since $M(X,Y,E)$ still depends on the input string $X$. However, the [original post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/15m/towards_a_new_decision_theory/) clarifies this, saying “Bayesian updating is not done explicitly in this decision theory”.\n* The counterfactual is logical because $P_Y$ and $M$ use the “mathematical intuition module”.\n\nIn the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) (p. 14), the action selection variant of FDT is written as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\\mathrm{FDT}(P,G,x) &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in \\mathcal A} \\mathbb E(\\mathcal U(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}) \\mid \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{\\small FDT}(\\underline P,\\underline G,\\underline x)=a)) \\\\ &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a\\in \\mathcal A} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}=o_j\\mid \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{\\small FDT}(\\underline P, \\underline G, \\underline x) = a))\\end{align}$$\n\nAgain, note that we are doing action selection (“$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in \\mathcal A}$”), using logical counterfactuals (“$\\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{\\small FDT}(\\underline P, \\underline G, \\underline x) = a)$”), and being updateless (absence of “$\\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x$”).\n\n## UDT1.1 and FDT (iterate over policies)\n\nUDT1.1 is a decision theory introduced by Wei Dai’s post [“Explicit Optimization of Global Strategy (Fixing a Bug in UDT1)”](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1s5/explicit_optimization_of_global_strategy_fixing_a/).\n\nIn [Hintze](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf) (p. 4, 12) UDT1.1 is written as follows:\n\n$$\\mathrm{UDT}(s) = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{f} \\sum_{i=1}^n U(O_i) \\cdot P(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{UDT} := f : s\\mapsto a \\urcorner \\mathbin{\\Box\\kern-7mu\\rightarrow} O_i)$$\n\nHere $f$ iterates over functions that map sense data ($s$) to actions ($a$), $U$ is the utility function, and $O_1,\\ldots,O_n$ are outcomes.\n\nUsing [Tyrrell McAllister’s notation](https://casparoesterheld.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/updateless_decision_theory-1.pdf), UDT1.1 looks like:\n\n$$\\mathrm{UDT}_{1.1}(\\mathbf X, \\mathbf Y, \\mathbf E, M, \\mathbf I) = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{f\\in \\mathbf I} \\sum_{E\\in\\mathbf E} M(f,E) U(E)$$\n\nUsing notation from the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) plus a trick I saw on [this Arbital page](https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5d6) we can write the policy selection variant of FDT as:\n\n$$(\\mathrm{FDT}(P,x))(x) = \\left(\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\pi\\in \\Pi} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}=o_j \\mid \\mathtt{true}(\\mathrm{\\small FDT}(\\underline P, \\underline x) = \\pi))\\right)(x)$$\n\nOn the right hand side, the large expression (the part inside and including the $\\operatorname{arg\\,max}$) returns a policy, so to get the action we call the policy on the observation $x$.\n\nThe important things to note are that UDT1.1 and the policy selection variant of FDT:\n\n* Do policy selection because the outermost iteration is over policies (“$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{f}$” or “$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{\\pi\\in \\Pi}$” depending on the notation). Quotes about policy selection: The [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) (p. 11, footnote 7) says “In the authors’ preferred formalization of FDT, agents actually iterate over *policies* (mappings from observations to actions) rather than actions. This makes a difference in certain multi-agent dilemmas, but will not make a difference in this paper.” See also comments by Vladimir Slepnev ([1](https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/2THFt7BChfCgwYDeA/let-s-discuss-functional-decision-theory/comment/6xLQAfYu4rJTN3MWJ), [2](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cAMhvPgMQJzhrpNdN/publication-of-anthropic-decision-theory#nW4bPcheDJ4ZAHCNb)).\n* Use logical counterfactuals (denoted by corner quotes and boxed arrow, the mathematical intuition $M$, or the $\\mathtt{true}$ operator).\n* Are updateless because they don’t condition on the observation (note the absence of conditioning of the form $\\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x$).\n\n## TDT\n\nMy understanding of TDT is mainly from\n[Hintze](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf).\nI am aware of the [TDT paper](https://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf) and skimmed it a while back,\nbut did not revisit it in the course of writing this post.\n\nUsing notation from [Hintze](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf) (p. 4, 11) the expected utility formula for TDT can be written as follows:\n\n$$\\mathrm{TDT}(s) = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a\\in\\mathcal A} \\sum_{i=1}^n U(O_i) P(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{TDT}(s) := a\\urcorner \\mathbin{\\Box\\kern-7mu\\rightarrow} O_i \\mid s)$$\n\nHere, $s$ is a string of sense data (a.k.a. observation), $\\mathcal A$ is the set of actions, $U$ is the utility function, $O_1,\\ldots,O_n$ are outcomes, the corner quotes and boxed arrow $\\mathbin{\\Box\\kern-7mu\\rightarrow}$ denote a logical counterfactual (“if the TDT algorithm were to output $a$ given input $s$”).\n\nIf I were to rewrite the above using notation from the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf), it would look like:\n\n$$\\mathrm{TDT}(P,x) = \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a\\in\\mathcal A} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME} = o_j \\mid \\mathrm{O\\small BS}=x, \\mathtt{true}(\\mathrm{\\small TDT}(\\underline P, \\underline x) = a))$$\n\nThe things to note are:\n\n* The outermost iteration is over actions (“$\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a\\in\\mathcal A}$”), so TDT does action selection.\n* We condition on the sense data $s$ or observation $\\mathrm{O\\small BS}=x$, so TDT is updateful. Quotes about TDT’s updatefulness: [this post](https://intelligence.org/2017/03/18/new-paper-cheating-death-in-damascus/) describes TDT as “a theory by MIRI senior researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky that made the mistake of conditioning on observations”. The [Updateless decision theories](https://arbital.com/p/updateless_dt/) page on Arbital calls TDT “updateful”. [Hintze](https://intelligence.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hintze-Problem-Class-Dominance-In-Predictive-Dilemmas.pdf) (p. 11): “TDP’s failure on the Curious Benefactor is straightforward. Upon seeing the coinflip has come up tails, it updates on the sensory data and realizes that it is in the causal branch where there is no possibility of getting a million.”\n* We use corner quotes and the boxed arrow, or the $\\mathtt{true}$ operator, to denote a logical counterfactual.\n\n## UDT2\n\nI know very little about UDT2, but based on [this\ncomment](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jhj/functional_side_effects/adhy) by Wei Dai\nand [this\npost](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wXxPmc9W6kPb6i7vj/notes-on-logical-priors-from-the-miri-workshop)\nby Vladimir Slepnev, it seems to iterate over algorithms rather than actions or\npolicies, and I am assuming it didn’t abandon updatelessness and logical counterfactuals.\n\nThe following search queries might have more information:\n\n* [“UDT2”](https://www.greaterwrong.com/search?q=%22UDT2%22)\n* [site:agentfoundations.org “UDT2”](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aagentfoundations.org%20%22UDT2%22)\n* [site:lesswrong.com “UDT2”](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Alesswrong.com%20%22UDT2%22)\n\n## LDT\n\nLDT (logical decision theory) seems to be an umbrella decision theory that only requires the use of\nlogical counterfactuals, leaving the iteration type and updatelessness\nunspecified. So my understanding is that UDT1, UDT1.1, UDT2, FDT, and TDT are\nall logical decision theories.\nSee [this Arbital page](https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5gc), which says:\n\n> “Logical decision theories” are really a family of recently proposed decision\n> theories, none of which stands out as being clearly ahead of the others in\n> all regards, but which are allegedly all better than causal decision theory.\n\nThe page also calls TDT a logical decision theory (listed under “non-general\nbut useful logical decision theories”).\n\n## CDT\n\nUsing notation from the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) (p. 13), we can write the expected utility formula for CDT as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\\mathrm{CDT}(P,G,x) &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A} \\mathbb E(\\mathcal U(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}) \\mid \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a), \\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x) \\\\ &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME} = o_j \\mid \\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a), \\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x)\\end{align}$$\n\nThings to note:\n\n* The outermost iteration is $\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A}$ so CDT does action selection.\n* We condition on $\\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x$ so CDT is updateful.\n* The presence of $\\mathtt{do}(\\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a)$ means we use causal counterfactuals.\n\n## EDT\n\nUsing notation from the [FDT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05060.pdf) (p. 12), we can write the expected utility formula for EDT as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\\mathrm{EDT}(P,x) &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A} \\mathbb E(\\mathcal U(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME}) \\mid \\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x, \\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a) \\\\ &= \\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathcal U(o_j)\\cdot P(\\mathrm{O\\small UTCOME} = o_j \\mid \\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x, \\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a)\\end{align}$$\n\nThings to note:\n\n* The outermost iteration is $\\operatorname*{arg\\,max}_{a \\in\\mathcal A}$ so EDT does action selection.\n* We condition on $\\mathrm{O\\small BS} = x$ so EDT is updateful.\n* We condition on $\\mathrm{A\\small CT}=a$ so EDT uses conditional probability as its counterfactual.\n\nThere are various versions of EDT (e.g. versions that smoke on the smoking\nlesion problem). The EDT in this post is the “naive” version. I don’t\nunderstand the more sophisticated versions of EDT, but the keyword for learning\nmore about them seems to be the [tickle defense](https://github.com/riceissa/project-ideas/issues/47).\n\n# Comparison on specific decision problems\n\nIf two decision theories are actually different, there should be some decision problem where they return different answers.\n\nThe FDT paper does a great job of distinguishing the logical-counterfactual decision theories from EDT and CDT.\nHowever, it doesn’t distinguish between different logical-counterfactual decision theories.\n\nThe following is a table that shows the disagreements between decision theories.\nFor each pair of decision theories specified by a row and column, the decision problem named in the cell is one where the decision theories return different answers.\nThe diagonal is blank because the decision theories are the same. The lower left triangle is blank because it repeats the entries in the mirror image (along the diagonal) spots.\n\n| |UDT1.1/FDT-policy|UDT1/FDT-action|TDT|EDT|CDT|\n|:---:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|**UDT1.1/FDT-policy**|–|Number assignment problem described in the [UDT1.1 post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g8xh9R7RaNitKtkaa/explicit-optimization-of-global-strategy-fixing-a-bug-in) (both UDT1 copies output “A”, the UDT1.1 copies output “A” and “B”)|[Counterfactual mugging](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging) (a.k.a. curious benefactor) (TDT refuses, UDT1.1 pays)|[Parfit’s hitchhiker](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Parfit%27s_hitchhiker) (EDT refuses, UDT1.1 pays)|[Newcomb’s problem](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Newcomb%27s_problem) (CDT two-boxes, UDT1.1 one-boxes)|\n|**UDT1/FDT-action**|–|–|Counterfactual mugging (a.k.a. curious benefactor) (TDT refuses, UDT1 pays)|Parfit’s hitchhiker (EDT refuses, UDT1 pays)|Newcomb’s problem (CDT two-boxes, UDT1 one-boxes)|\n|**TDT**|–|–|–|Parfit’s hitchhiker (EDT refuses, TDT pays)|Newcomb’s problem (CDT two-boxes, TDT one-boxes)|\n|**EDT**|–|–|–|–|Newcomb’s problem (CDT two-boxes, EDT one-boxes)|\n|**CDT**|–|–|–|–|–|\n\n# Other comparisons\n\nHere are some existing comparisons between decision theories that I found\nuseful, along with reasons why I felt the current post was needed.\n\n* [“Decision-theoretic problems and Theories; An (Incomplete) comparative list”](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWEhuXQBxRwxmhER5/decision-theoretic-problems-and-theories-an-incomplete) by somervta.\n  This list is useful and modern but doesn’t include the different versions of UDT and FDT.\n* [“A comprehensive list of decision\n  theories”](https://casparoesterheld.com/a-comprehensive-list-of-decision-theories/)\n  by Caspar Oesterheld and/or Johannes Treutlein.

      "markdown": "**Followup to**: [Counterfactual Mugging](/lw/3l/counterfactual_mugging/).\n\nLet's see what happens with [Counterfactual Mugging](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging), if we replace the uncertainty about an external fact of how a coin lands, with logical uncertainty, for example about what is the n-th place in the [decimal expansion of pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_%CF%80).\n\nThe original thought experiment is as follows:\n\n> [Omega](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Omega) appears and says that it has just tossed a fair coin, and given that the coin came up tails, it decided to ask you to give it $100. Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100. But Omega also tells you that if the coin came up heads instead of tails, it'd give you $10000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 if the coin came up tails.\n\nLet's change \"coin came up tails\" to \"10000-th digit of pi is even\", and correspondingly for heads. This gives _Logical Counterfactual Mugging_:\n\n> Omega appears and says that it has just found out what that 10000th decimal digit of pi is 8, and given that it is even, it decided to ask you to give it $100. Whatever you do in this situation, nothing else will happen differently in reality as a result. Naturally you don't want to give up your $100. But Omega also tells you that if the 10000th digit of pi turned out to be odd instead, it'd give you $10000, but only if you'd agree to give it $100 given that the 10000th digit is even.\n\nThis form of Counterfactual Mugging may be instructive, as it slaughters the following false intuition, or equivalently conceptualization of \"could\": \"the coin _could_ land either way, but a logical truth _couldn't_ be either way\".\n\nFor the following, let's shift the perspective to Omega, and consider the problem about 10001th digit, which is 5 (odd). It's easy to imagine that given that the 10001th digit of pi is in fact 5, and you decided to only give away the $100 if the digit is odd, then Omega's prediction of your actions will still be that you'd give away $100 (because the digit is in fact odd). Direct prediction of your actions _can't_ include the part where you observe that the digit is even, because the digit is odd.\n\nBut Omega doesn't compute what you'll do in reality, it computes what you _would_ do _if the 10001th digit of pi was even_ (which it isn't). If you decline to give away the $100 if the digit is even, Omega's simulation _of counterfactual_ where the digit is even _will_ say that you wouldn't oblige, and so you won't get the $10000 in reality, where the digit is odd.\n\nImagine it constructively this way: you have the code of a procedure, Pi(n), that computes the n-th digit of pi once it's run. If your strategy is\n\n> if(Is_Odd(Pi(n))) then Give(\"$100\");\n\nthen, given that n==10001, Pi(10001)==5, and Is_Odd(5)==**true**, the program outputs \"$100\". But Omega tests what's the output of the code on which it performed a surgery, replacing Is_Odd(Pi(n)) by **false** instead of **true** to which it normally evaluates. Thus it'll be testing the code\n\n> if(**false**) then Give(\"$100\");\n\nThis counterfactual case doesn't give away $100, and so Omega decides that you won't get the $10000.\n\nFor the original problem, when you consider what would happen if the coin fell differently, you are basically performing the same surgery, replacing the knowledge about the state of the coin in the state of mind. If you use the (wrong) strategy\n\n> if(Coin==\"heads\") then Give(\"$100\")\n\nand the coin comes up \"heads\", so that Omega is deciding whether to give you $10000, then Coin==\"heads\", but Omega is evaluating the modified algorithm where Coin is replaced by \"tails\":\n\n> if(\"tails\"==\"heads\") then Give(\"$100\")\n\nAnother way of intuitively thinking about Logical CM is to consider the index of the digit (here, 10000 or 10001) to be a random variable. Then, the choice of number n (value of the random variable) in Omega's question is a perfect analogy with the outcome of a coin toss.\n\nWith a random index instead of \"direct\" mathematical uncertainty, the above evaluation of counterfactual uses (say) 10000 to replace n (so that Is_Odd(Pi(10000))==**false**), instead of directly using **false** to replace Is_Odd(P(n)) with **false**:\n\n> if(Is_Odd(Pi(10000))) then Give(\"$100\");\n\nThe difference is that with the coin or random digit number, the parameter is explicit and atomic (Coin and n, respectively), while with the oddness of n-th digit, the parameter Is_Odd(P(n)) isn't atomic. How can it be detected in the code (in the mind) — it could be written in obfuscated assembly, not even an explicit subexpression of the program? By the connection to the [sense](/lw/15n/sense_denotation_and_semantics/) of the problem statement itself: when you are talking about what you'll do if the n-th digit of pi is even or odd, or what Omega will do if you give or not give away $100 in each case, you are talking about exactly your Is_Odd(Pi(n)), or something from which this code will be constructed. The meaning of procedure Pi(n) is dependent on the meaning of the problem, and through this dependency counterfactual surgery can reach down and change the details of the algorithm to answer the counterfactual query posed by the problem."

Player B loses < refresh to render LaTeX > dollars if the card is low and < refresh to render LaTeX > dollars if the card is high.\n\nNote that Player B has been given a proper scoring rule, and so is incentivized to give his true probability (unless he makes some deal with player A).\n\nYou are playing this game as player A. You only play one time. You are looking at a low card. Player B is not trying to make a deal with you, and will report his true probability. Player B is very good at reasoning about you, but you are in a separate room, so Player B cannot read any tells unless you show the card. Do you show your card?\n\nSince your card is low, if you show it to player B, you will lose nothing, and get the best possible output. However, if player B reasons that if you would show your card if it was low, then in the counterfactual world in which you got a high card, player B would know you had a high card because you refused to show. Thus, you would lose a full dollar in those counterfactual worlds.\n\nIf you choose to not reveal your card, player B would assign probability 1/2 and you would lose a quarter.\n\nI like this variant of the counterfactual mugging because it takes the agency out of the predictor. In the standard counterfactual mugging, you might reject the hypothetical and think that the predictor is trying to trick you. Here, there is a sense in which you are creating the counterfactual mugging yourself by trying to be able to keep secrets.\n\nAlso, think about this example the next time you are tempted to say that someone would only [Glomarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response) if they had an important secret."

      "markdown": "**Followup to**:  [Torture vs. Dust Specks](/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/), [Zut Allais](/lw/mz/zut_allais/), [Rationality Quotes 4](/lw/n0/rationality_quotes_4/)\n\nSuppose that a disease, or a monster, or a war, or something, is killing people.  And suppose you only have enough resources to implement one of the following two options:\n\n1.  Save 400 lives, with certainty.\n2.  Save 500 lives, with 90% probability; save no lives, 10% probability.\n\nMost people choose option 1.  Which, I think, is foolish; because if you multiply 500 lives by 90% probability, you get an expected value of 450 lives, which exceeds the 400-life value of option 1.  (Lives saved don't diminish in marginal utility, so this is an appropriate calculation.)\n\n\"What!\" you cry, incensed.  \"How can you gamble with human lives? How can you think about numbers when so much is at stake?  What if that 10% probability strikes, and everyone dies?  So much for your damned logic!  You're following your rationality off a cliff!\"\n\nAh, but here's the interesting thing.  If you present the options this way:\n\n1.  100 people die, with certainty.\n2.  90% chance no one dies; 10% chance 500 people die.\n\nThen a majority choose option 2.  _Even though it's the same gamble._  You see, just as a _certainty_ of saving 400 lives seems to _feel_ so much more comfortable than an unsure gain, so too, a certain loss _feels_ worse than an uncertain one.\n\nYou can grandstand on the second description too:  \"How can you condemn 100 people to certain death when there's such a good chance you can save them?  We'll all share the risk!  Even if it was only a 75% chance of saving everyone, it would still be worth it - so long as there's a chance - everyone makes it, or no one does!\"\n\nYou know what?  This isn't about your feelings.  A human life, with all its joys and all its pains, adding up over the course of decades, is worth far more than your brain's feelings of comfort or discomfort with a plan.  Does computing the expected utility feel too cold-blooded for your taste?  Well, that feeling isn't even a feather in the scales, when a life is at stake.  Just shut up and multiply.\n\n[Previously on Overcoming Bias](/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/), I asked what was the least bad, bad thing that could happen, and suggested that it was getting a dust speck in your eye that irritated you for a fraction of a second, barely long enough to notice, before it got blinked away.  And conversely, a very bad thing to happen, if not the worst thing, would be getting tortured for 50 years.\n\nNow, would you rather that a googolplex people got dust specks in their eyes, or that one person was tortured for 50 years?  I originally asked this question with a vastly larger number - an incomprehensible mathematical magnitude - but a googolplex works fine for this illustration.\n\nMost people chose the dust specks over the torture.  Many were proud of this choice, and indignant that anyone should choose otherwise:  \"How dare you condone torture!\"\n\nThis matches research showing that there are \"sacred values\", like human lives, and \"unsacred values\", like money.  When you try to trade off a sacred value against an unsacred value, subjects express great indignation (sometimes they want to punish the person who made the suggestion).\n\nMy favorite anecdote along these lines - though my books are packed at the moment, so no citation for now - comes from a team of researchers who evaluated the effectiveness of a certain project, calculating the cost per life saved, and recommended to the government that the project be implemented because it was cost-effective.  The governmental agency rejected the report because, they said, you couldn't put a dollar value on human life.  After rejecting the report, the agency decided _not_ to implement the measure.\n\nTrading off a sacred value (like refraining from torture) against an unsacred value (like dust specks) _feels really awful._  To merely multiply utilities would be too cold-blooded - it would be following rationality off a cliff...\n\nBut let me ask you this.  Suppose you had to choose between one person being tortured for 50 years, and a googol people being tortured for 49 years, 364 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.  You would choose one person being tortured for 50 years, I do presume; otherwise I give up on you.\n\nAnd similarly, if you had to choose between a googol people tortured for 49.9999999 years, and a googol-squared people being tortured for 49.9999998 years, you would pick the former.\n\nA googolplex is ten to the googolth power.  That's a googol/100 factors of a googol.  So we can keep doing this, gradually - _very_ gradually - diminishing the degree of discomfort, and multiplying by a factor of a googol each time, until we choose between a googolplex people getting a dust speck in their eye, and a googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks in their eye.\n\nIf you find your preferences are circular here, that makes rather a mockery of moral grandstanding.  If you drive from San Jose to San Francisco to Oakland to San Jose, over and over again, you may have fun driving, but you aren't _going_ anywhere.  Maybe you think it a great display of virtue to choose for a googolplex people to get dust specks rather than one person being tortured.  But if you would also trade a googolplex people getting one dust speck for a googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks et cetera, you sure aren't _helping anyone._  Circular preferences may work for feeling noble, but not for feeding the hungry or healing the sick.\n\nAltruism isn't the warm fuzzy feeling you get from being altruistic.  If you're doing it for the spiritual benefit, that is nothing but selfishness.  The primary thing is to help others, whatever the means.  So shut up and multiply!\n\nAnd if it seems to you that there is a fierceness to this maximization, like the bare sword of the law, or the burning of the sun - if it seems to you that at the center of this rationality there is a small cold flame -\n\nWell, the other way might feel better inside you.  But it wouldn't work.\n\nAnd I say also this to you:  That if you set aside your regret for all the spiritual satisfaction you _could_ be having - if you _wholeheartedly_ pursue the Way, without thinking that you are being cheated - if you give yourself over to rationality without holding back, you will find that rationality gives to you in return.\n\nBut _that_ part only works if you don't go around saying to yourself, \"It would feel better inside me if only I could be less rational.\"\n\nChimpanzees feel, but they don't multiply.  Should you be sad that you have the opportunity to do better?  You cannot attain your full potential if you regard your gift as a burden.\n\n_Added:_  If you'd still take the dust specks, see [Unknown's comment](/lw/n3/circular_altruism/u7b) on the problem with qualitative versus quantitative distinctions."

If you haven't, it's only three quick questions, <a href=\"https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/06/24/can-you-correctly-answer-the-cognitive-reflection-test-83-percent-of-people-miss-at-least-1-question/\">go and do it now</a>.</em></p>\n<p>One of the striking early examples in Kahneman's <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is the following problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much does the ball cost? _____ cents</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This question first turns up informally in <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4069/615a36c33e61ca309b8ceaeb628a10d441b5.pdf\">a paper by Kahneman and Frederick</a>, who find that most people get it wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Almost everyone we ask reports an initial tendency to answer “10 cents” because the sum $1.10 separates naturally into $1 and 10 cents, and 10 cents is about the right magnitude. Many people yield to this immediate impulse. The surprisingly high rate of errors in this easy problem illustrates how lightly System 2 monitors the output of System 1: people are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that quickly comes to mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, the bat and ball problem is used as an introduction to the major theme of the book: the distinction between fluent, spontaneous, fast 'System 1' mental processes, and effortful, reflective and slow 'System 2' ones. The explicit moral is that we are too willing to lean on System 1, and this gets us into trouble:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This story is very compelling in the case of the bat and ball problem. I got this problem wrong myself when I first saw it, and still find the intuitive-but-wrong answer very plausible looking. I have to consciously remind myself to apply some extra effort and get the correct answer.</p>\n<p>However, this becomes more complicated when you start considering other tests of this fast-vs-slow distinction. Frederick later combined the bat and ball problem with two other questions to <a href=\"http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Shane-Frederick-Cognitive-Re%EF%AC%82ection-and-Decision-Making.pdf\">create the Cognitive Reflection Test</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(2) If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? _____ minutes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake? _____ days</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These are designed to also have an 'intuitive-but-wrong' answer (100 minutes, 24 days), and an 'effortful-but-right' answer (5 minutes, 47 days). But this time I <a href=\"https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/stupid-bat-and-ball/\">seem to be immune to the wrong answers</a>, in a way that just doesn't happen with the bat and ball:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I always have the same reaction, and I don’t know if it’s common or I’m just the lone idiot with this problem. The ‘obvious wrong answers’ for 2. and 3. are completely unappealing to me (I had to look up 3. to check what the obvious answer was supposed to be). Obviously the machine-widget ratio hasn’t changed, and obviously exponential growth works like exponential growth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I see 1., however, I always think ‘oh it’s that bastard bat and ball question again, I know the correct answer but cannot see it’. And I have to stare at it for a minute or so to work it out, slowed down dramatically by the fact that Obvious Wrong Answer is jumping up and down trying to distract me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this test was really testing my propensity for effortful thought over spontaneous intuition, I ought to score zero. I hate effortful thought! As it is, I score two out of three, because I've trained my intuitions nicely for ratios and exponential growth. The 'intuitive', 'System 1' answer that pops into my head is, in fact, the correct answer, and the supposedly 'intuitive-but-wrong' answers feel bad on a visceral level. (Why the hell would the lily pads take the same amount of time to cover the second half of the lake as the first half, when the rate of growth is increasing?)</p>\n<p>The bat and ball still gets me, though. My gut hasn't internalised anything useful, and it's super keen on shouting out the wrong answer in a distracting way. My dislike for effortful thought is definitely a problem here.</p>\n<p>I wanted to see if others had raised the same objection, so I started doing some research into the CRT. In the process I discovered a lot of follow-up work that makes the story much more complex and interesting.</p>\n<p>I've come nowhere near to doing a proper literature review. Frederick's original paper has been cited nearly 3000 times, and dredging through that for the good bits is a lot more work than I'm willing to put in. This is just a summary of the interesting stuff I found on my limited, partial dig through the literature.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Thinking__inherently_fast_and_inherently_slow\">Thinking, inherently fast and inherently slow</h1>\n<p>Frederick's original Cognitive Reflection Test paper describes the System 1/System 2 divide in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Recognizing that the face of the person entering the classroom belongs to your math teacher involves System 1 processes — it occurs instantly and effortlessly and is unaffected by intellect, alertness, motivation or the difficulty of the math problem being attempted at the time. Conversely, finding <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\sqrt{19163}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msqrt\"><span class=\"mjx-box\" style=\"padding-top: 0.045em;\"><span class=\"mjx-surd\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">√</span></span><span class=\"mjx-box\" style=\"padding-top: 0.119em; border-top: 1px solid;\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">19163</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to two decimal places without a calculator involves System 2 processes — mental operations requiring effort, motivation, concentration, and the execution of learned rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find it interesting that he frames mental processes as being <em>inherently</em> effortless or effortful, independent of the person doing the thinking. This is not quite true even for the examples he gives — faceblind people and calculating prodigies exist.</p>\n<p>This framing is important for interpreting the CRT. If the problem inherently has a wrong 'System 1 solution' and a correct 'System 2 solution', the CRT can work as intended, as an efficient tool to split people by their propensity to use one strategy or the other. If there are 'System 1' ways to get the correct answer, the whole thing gets much more muddled, and it's hard to disentangle natural propensity to reflection from prior exposure to the right mathematical concepts.</p>\n<p>My tentative guess is that the bat and ball problem <em>is</em> close to being this kind of efficient tool. Although in some ways it's the simplest of the three problems, solving it in a 'fast', 'intuitive' way relies on seeing the problem in a way that most people's education won't have provided. (I <em>think</em> this is true, anyway - I'll go into more detail later.) I suspect that this is less true the other two problems - ratios and exponential growth are topics that a mathematical or scientific education is more likely to build intuition for.</p>\n<p>(Aside: I'd like to know how these other two problems were chosen. The paper just states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Motivated by this result [the answers to the bat and ball question], two other problems found to yield impulsive erroneous responses were included with the “bat and ball” problem to form a simple, three-item “Cognitive Reflection Test” (CRT), shown in Figure 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have a vague suspicion that Frederick trawled through something like 'The Bumper Book of Annoying Riddles' to find some brainteasers that don't require too much in the way of mathematical prerequisites. The lilypads one has a family resemblance to the classic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem\">grains-of-wheat-on-a-chessboard puzzle</a>, for instance.)</p>\n<p>However, I haven't found any great evidence either way for this guess. The original paper doesn't break down participants' scores by question – it just gives mean scores on the test as a whole. I did however find <a href=\"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/68049/1/MPRA_paper_68049.pdf\">this meta-analysis of 118 CRT studies</a>, which shows that the bat and ball question is the most difficult on average – only 32% of all participants get it right, compared with 40% for the widgets and 48% for the lilypads. It also has the biggest jump in success rate when comparing university students with non-students. That looks like better mathematical education does help on the bat and ball, but it doesn't clear up how it helps. It could improve participants' ability to intuitively see the answer. Or it could improve ability to come up with an 'unintuitive' solution, like solving the corresponding simultaneous equations by a rote method.</p>\n<p>What I'd really like is some insight into what individual people <em>actually do</em> when they try to solve the problems, rather than just this aggregate statistical information. I haven't found exactly what I wanted, but I did turn up a few interesting studies on the way.</p>\n<h1 id=\"No__seriously__the_answer_isn_t_ten_cents\">No, seriously, the answer isn't ten cents</h1>\n<p>My favourite thing I found was <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/workshop/leo/document/Frederick_Bat-BallProblem.pdf\">this (apparently unpublished) ‘extremely rough draft’</a> by Meyer, Spunt and Frederick from 2013, revisiting the bat and ball problem. The intuitive-but-wrong answer turns out to be <em>extremely</em> sticky, and the paper is basically a series of increasingly desperate attempts to get people to actually think about the question.</p>\n<p>One conjecture for what people are doing when they get this question wrong is the <em>attribute substitution hypothesis</em>. This was <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/853c/2304f0b6455f27677023e19ffc30dc6ca683.pdf\">suggested early on by Kahneman and Frederick</a>, and is a fancy way of saying that they are instead solving the following simpler problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How much does the ball cost? _____ cents</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice that this is missing the 'more than the ball' clause at the end, turning the question into a much simpler arithmetic problem. This simple problem <em>does</em> have 'ten cents' as the answer, so it's very plausible that people are getting confused by it.</p>\n<p>Meyer, Spunt and Frederick tested this hypothesis by getting respondents to recall the problem from memory. This showed a clear difference: 94% of 'five cent' respondents could recall the correct question, but only 61% of 'ten cent' respondents. It's possible that there is a different common cause of both the 'ten cent' response and misremembering the question, but it at least gives some support for the substitution hypothesis.</p>\n<p>However, getting people to actually answer the question correctly was a much more difficult problem. First they tried  bolding the words <strong>more than the ball</strong> to make this clause more salient. This made surprisingly little impact: 29% of respondents solved it, compared with 24% for the original problem. Printing both versions was slightly more successful, bumping up the correct response to 35%, but it was still a small effect.</p>\n<p>After this, they ditched subtlety and resorted to pasting these huge warnings above the question:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://drossbucket.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/bat_and_ball.png\" alt=\"Computation warning: 'Be careful! Many people miss the following problem because they do not take the time to check their answer. Comprehension warning: 'Be careful! Many people miss the following problem because they read it too quickly and actually answer a different question than the one that was asked.'\"></p>\n<p>These were still only mildly effective, with a correct solution jumping to 50% from 45%. People just really like the answer 'ten cents', it seems.</p>\n<p>At this point they completely gave up and just flat out added “HINT: 10 cents is not the answer.” This worked reasonably well, though there was still a hard core of 13% who persisted in writing down 'ten cents'.</p>\n<p>That's where they left it. At this point there's not really any room to escalate beyond confiscating the respondents' pens and prefilling in the answer 'five cents', and I worry that somebody would still try and scratch in 'ten cents' in their own blood. The wrong answer is just incredibly compelling.</p>\n<h1 id=\"So__what_are_people_doing_when_they_solve_this_problem_\">So, what <em>are</em> people doing when they solve this problem?</h1>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's hard to tell from the published literature (or at least what I found of it). What I'd really like is lots of transcripts of individuals talking through their problem solving process. The closest I found was <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2017.1292954\">this paper</a> by Szaszi et al, who did carry out these sort of interview, but it doesn't include any examples of individual responses. Instead, it gives a aggregated overview of types of responses, which doesn't go into the kind of detail I'd like.</p>\n<p>Still, the examples given for their response categories give a few clues. The categories are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct answer, correct start.</strong> Example given: 'I see. This is an equation. Thus if the ball equals to x, the bat equals to x plus 1... '</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Correct answer, incorrect start.</strong> Example: 'I would say 10 cents... But this cannot be true as it does not sum up to €1.10...'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Incorrect answer, reflective</strong>, i.e. some effort was made to reconsider the answer given, even if it was ultimately incorrect. Example: '... but I'm not sure... If together they cost €1.10, and the bat costs €1 more than the ball... the solution should be 10 cents. I'm done.'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>No reflection.</strong> Example: 'Ok. I'm done.'</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These demonstrate one way to reason your way to the correct answer (solve the simultaneous equations) and one way to be wrong (just blurt out the answer). They also demonstrate one way to recover from an incorrect solution (think about the answer you blurted out and see if it actually works). Still, it's all rather abstract and high level.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How_To_Solve_It\">How To Solve It</h1>\n<p>However, I did manage to stumble onto another source of insight. While researching the problem I came across <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/a-new-twist-on-a-classic-puzzle.html\">this article</a> from the online magazine of the Association for Psychological Science, which discusses a variant 'Ford and Ferrari problem'. This is quite interesting in itself, but I was most excited by the comments section. Finally some examples of how the problem is solved in the wild!</p>\n<p>The simplest 'analytical', 'System 2' solution is to rewrite the problem as two simultaneous linear equations and plug-and-chug your way to the correct answer.

It's a very reliable way to tackle the problem: if you already know how to do this sort of rote method, there are no surprises. This sort of method would work for any similar problem involving linear equations.</p>\n<p>However, it's pretty obvious that a lot of people <em>won't</em> have access to this method. Plenty of people noped out of mathematics long before they got to simultaneous equations, so they won't be able to solve it this way. What might be less obvious, at least if you mostly live in a high-maths-ability bubble, is that these people may also be missing the sort of tacit mathematical background that would even allow them to frame the problem in a useful form in the first place.</p>\n<p>That sounds a bit abstract, so let's look at some responses (I'll paste all these straight in, so any typos are in the original). First, we have these two confused commenters:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The thing is, why does the ball have to be $.05? It could have been .04 0r.03 and the bat would still cost more than $1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is exactly what bothers me and resulted in me wanting to look up the question online. On the quiz the other 2 questions were definitive. This one technically could have more than one answer so this is where phycologists actually mess up when trying to give us a trick question. The ball at .4 and the bat at 1.06 doesn’t break the rule either.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These commenters don't automatically see two equations in two variables that together are enough to constrain the problem. Instead they seem to focus mainly on the first condition (adding up to $1.10) and just use the second one as a vague check at best ('the bat would still cost more than $1'). This means that they are unable to immediately tell that the problem has a unique solution.</p>\n<p>In response, another commenter, Tony, suggests a correct solution which is an interesting mix of writing the problem out formally and then figuring out the answer by trial and error:\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I hear your pain. I feel as though psychologists and psychiatrists get together every now and then to prove how stoopid I am. However, after more than a little head scratching I’ve gained an understanding of this puzzle. It can be expressed as two facts and a question A=100+B and A+B=110, so B=? If B=2 then the solution would be 100+2+2 and A+B would be 104. If B=6 then the solution would be 100+6+6 and A+B would be 112. But as be KNOW A+B=110 the only number for B on it’s own is 5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This suggests enough half-remembered mathematical knowledge to find a sensible abstract framing, but not enough to solve it the standard way.</p>\n<p>Finally, commenter Marlo Eugene provides an ingenious way of solving the problem without writing all the algebraic steps out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Linguistics makes all the difference. The conceptual emphasis seems to lie within the word MORE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>X + Y = $1.10. If X = $1 MORE then that leaves $0.10 TO WORK WITH rather than automatically assign to Y</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So you divide the remainder equally (assuming negative values are disqualified) and get 0.05.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even this small sample of comments suggests a wide diversity of problem-solving methods leading to the two common answers. Further, these solutions don't all split neatly into 'System 1' 'intuitive' and 'System 2' 'analytic'. Marlo Eugene's solution, for instance, is a mixed solution of writing the equations down in a formal way, but then finding a clever way of just seeing the answer rather than solving them by rote.</p>\n<p>I'd still appreciate more detailed transcripts, including the time taken to solve the problem. My suspicion is still that very few people solve this problem with a fast intuitive response, in the way that I rapidly see the correct answer to the lilypad question. Even the more 'intuitive' responses, like Marlo Eugene's, seem to rely on some initial careful reflection and a good initial framing of the problem.</p>\n<p>If I'm correct about this lack of fast responses, my tentative guess for the reason is that it has something to do with the way most of us learn simultaneous equations in school. We generally learn arithmetic as young children in a fairly concrete way, with the formal numerical problems supplemented with lots of specific examples of adding up apples and bananas and so forth.</p>\n<p>But then, for some reason, this goes completely out of the window once the unknown quantity isn't sitting on its own on one side of the equals sign. This is instead hived off into its own separate subject, called 'algebra', and the rules are taught much later in a much more formalised style, without much attempt to build up intuition first.</p>\n<p>(One exception is the sort of puzzle sheets that are often given to young kids, where the unknowns are just empty boxes to be filled in. Sometimes you get 2+3=□, sometimes it's 2+□=5, but either way you go about the same process of using your wits to figure out the answer. Then, for some reason I'll never understand, the worksheets get put away and the poor kids don't see the subject again until years later, when the box is now called <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span></span></span></span> for some reason and you have to find the answer by defined rules. Anyway, this is a separate rant.)</p>\n<p>This lack of a rich background in puzzling out the answer to specific concrete problems means most of us lean hard on formal rules in this domain, even if we're relatively mathematically sophisticated. Only a few build up the necessary repertoire of tricks to solve the problem quickly by insight. I'm reminded of a story in Feynman's <em>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Around that time my cousin, who was three years older, was in high school. He was having considerable difficulty with his algebra, so a tutor would come. I was allowed to sit in a corner while the tutor would try to teach my cousin algebra. I'd hear him talking about x.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I said to my cousin, \"What are you trying to do?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'm trying to find out what x is, like in 2x + 7 = 15.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I say, \"You mean 4.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yeah, but you did it by arithmetic. You have to do it by algebra.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I learned algebra, fortunately, not by going to school, but by finding my aunt's old schoolbook in the attic, and understanding that the whole idea was to find out what <em>x</em> is - it doesn't make any difference how you do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this reliance on formal methods might be somewhat less true for exponential growth and ratios, the subjects underpinning the lilypad and widget questions. Certainly I seem to have better intuition there, without having to resort to rote calculation. But I'm not sure how general this is.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How_To_Visualise_It\">How To Visualise It</h1>\n<p>If you wanted to solve the bat and ball problem without having to 'do it by algebra', how would you go about it?</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/stupid-bat-and-ball/\">original post</a> on the problem was a pretty quick, throwaway job, but over time it picked up some truly excellent comments by anders and Kyzentun, which really start to dig into the structure of the problem and suggest ways to 'just see' the answer. The thread with anders in particular goes into lots of other examples of how we think through solving various problems, and is well worth reading in full. I'll only summarise the bat-and-ball-related parts of the comments here.</p>\n<p>We all used some variant of the method suggested by Marlo Eugene in the comments above. Writing out the basic problem again, we have:</p>\n<p><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"B + b = 110\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">B</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">+</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">b</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">110</span></span></span></span></span></span>,\n<span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"B - b = 100\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">B</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">−</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">b</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">100</span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>Now, instead of immediately jumping to the standard method of eliminating one of the variables, we can just look at what these two equations are saying and solve it directly 'by thinking'. We have a bat, <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"B\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">B</span></span></span></span></span></span>. If you add the price of the ball, <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"b\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">b</span></span></span></span></span></span>, you get 110 cents. If you instead remove the same quantity <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"b\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">b</span></span></span></span></span></span> you get 100 cents. So the bat's price must be exactly halfway between these two numbers, at 105 cents. That leaves five for the ball.</p>\n<p>Now that I'm thinking of the problem in this way, I directly see the equations as being 'about a bat that's halfway between 100 and 110 cents', and the answer is incredibly obvious.</p>\n<p>Kyzentun suggests a variant on the problem that is much less counterintuitive than the original:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A centered piece of text and its margins are 110 columns wide. The text is 100 columns wide. How wide is one margin?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Same numbers, same mathematical formula to reach the solution. But less misleading because you know there are two margins, and thus know to divide by two after subtracting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the original problem, the 110 units and 100 units both refer to something abstract, the sum and difference of the bat and ball. In Kyzentun's version these become much more concrete objects, the width of the text and the total width of the margins. The work of seeing the equations as relating to something concrete has mostly been done for you.</p>\n<p>Similarly, anders works the problem by 'getting rid of the 100 cents', and splitting the remainder in half to get at the price of the ball:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I just had an easy time with #1 which I haven’t before.

I've written about <a href=\"https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/a-braindump-on-derrida-and-close-reading/\">close reading</a> recently, and this has been something like a close reading of the bat and ball problem.</p>\n<p>Frederick's original paper on the Cognitive Reflection Test is in that generic social science style where you define a new metric and then see how it correlates with a bunch of other macroscale factors (either big social categories like gender or education level, or the results of other statistical tests that try to measure factors like time preference or risk preference). There's a strange indifference to the details of the test itself – at no point does he discuss why he picked those specific three questions, and there's no attempt to model what was making the intuitive-but-wrong answer appealing.</p>\n<p>The later paper by Meyer, Spunt and Frederick is much more interesting to me, because it really starts to pick apart the specifics of the bat and ball problem. Is an easier question getting substituted? Can participants reproduce the correct question from memory?</p>\n<p>I learned the most from the individual responses, though. This is where you really get to see the variety of ways that people tackle the problem. Careful reflection definitely seems to improve the chance of a correct answer in general, but many of the responses don't really fit the neat 'fast vs slow' division of the original setup.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Questions\">Questions</h1>\n<p>I'm interested in any comments on the post, but here are a few specific things I'd like to get your answers to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>My rapid, intuitive answer for the bat and ball question is wrong (at least until I retrained it by thinking about the problem way too much). However, for the other two I 'just see' the correct answer.

This isn't at all my field and I'd be interested in any good sources. I'd kind of assumed that there'd be some kind of serious-business Test Creation Methodology, but for the CRT at least it looks like people just noticed they got surprising answers for the bat and ball question and looked around for similar questions. Is that unusual compared to other psychological tests?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "markdown": "*Cross posted from [my personal blog](https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/the-bat-and-ball-problem-revisited/).*\n\n*In this post, I'm going to assume you've come across the Cognitive Reflection Test before and know the answers. If you haven't, it's only three quick questions, [go and do it now][crt].*\n\n[crt]:https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2013/06/24/can-you-correctly-answer-the-cognitive-reflection-test-83-percent-of-people-miss-at-least-1-question/\n\nOne of the striking early examples in Kahneman's *Thinking, Fast and Slow* is the following problem:\n\n> (1) A bat and a ball cost \\$1.10 in total. The bat costs \\$1.00 more than the ball. \n\n> How much does the ball cost? _____ cents\n\nThis question first turns up informally in [a paper by Kahneman and Frederick][kf], who find that most people get it wrong:\n\n> Almost everyone we ask reports an initial tendency to answer “10 cents” because the sum \\$1.10 separates naturally into \\$1 and 10 cents, and 10 cents is about the right magnitude. Many people yield to this immediate impulse. The surprisingly high rate of errors in this easy problem illustrates how lightly System 2 monitors the output of System 1: people are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that quickly comes to mind.\n\nIn *Thinking Fast and Slow*, the bat and ball problem is used as an introduction to the major theme of the book: the distinction between fluent, spontaneous, fast 'System 1' mental processes, and effortful, reflective and slow 'System 2' ones. The explicit moral is that we are too willing to lean on System 1, and this gets us into trouble:\n\n> The bat-and-ball problem is our first encounter with an observation that will be a recurrent theme of this book: many people are overconfident, prone to place too much faith in their intuitions. They apparently find cognitive effort at least mildly unpleasant and avoid it as much as possible.\n\n[kf]:https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4069/615a36c33e61ca309b8ceaeb628a10d441b5.pdf\n\nThis story is very compelling in the case of the bat and ball problem. I got this problem wrong myself when I first saw it, and still find the intuitive-but-wrong answer very plausible looking. I have to consciously remind myself to apply some extra effort and get the correct answer.\n\nHowever, this becomes more complicated when you start considering other tests of this fast-vs-slow distinction. Frederick later combined the bat and ball problem with two other questions to [create the Cognitive Reflection Test][frederickcrt]:\n\n> (2) If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? _____ minutes\n\n> (3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake? _____ days\n\n[frederickcrt]:http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Shane-Frederick-Cognitive-Re%EF%AC%82ection-and-Decision-Making.pdf\n\nThese are designed to also have an 'intuitive-but-wrong' answer (100 minutes, 24 days), and an 'effortful-but-right' answer (5 minutes, 47 days). But this time I [seem to be immune to the wrong answers][stupid], in a way that just doesn't happen with the bat and ball:\n\n> I always have the same reaction, and I don’t know if it’s common or I’m just the lone idiot with this problem. The ‘obvious wrong answers’ for 2. and 3. are completely unappealing to me (I had to look up 3. to check what the obvious answer was supposed to be). Obviously the machine-widget ratio hasn’t changed, and obviously exponential growth works like exponential growth.\n\n> When I see 1., however, I always think ‘oh it’s that bastard bat and ball question again, I know the correct answer but cannot see it’. And I have to stare at it for a minute or so to work it out, slowed down dramatically by the fact that Obvious Wrong Answer is jumping up and down trying to distract me.\n\n[stupid]:https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2017/02/14/stupid-bat-and-ball/\n\nIf this test was really testing my propensity for effortful thought over spontaneous intuition, I ought to score zero. I hate effortful thought! As it is, I score two out of three, because I've trained my intuitions nicely for ratios and exponential growth. The 'intuitive', 'System 1' answer that pops into my head is, in fact, the correct answer, and the supposedly 'intuitive-but-wrong' answers feel bad on a visceral level. (Why the hell would the lily pads take the same amount of time to cover the second half of the lake as the first half, when the rate of growth is increasing?) \n\n[twenty]:https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/07/29/20-fundamentals/\n\nThe bat and ball still gets me, though. My gut hasn't internalised anything useful, and it's super keen on shouting out the wrong answer in a distracting way. My dislike for effortful thought is definitely a problem here.\n\nI wanted to see if others had raised the same objection, so I started doing some research into the CRT. In the process I discovered a lot of follow-up work that makes the story much more complex and interesting.\n\nI've come nowhere near to doing a proper literature review. Frederick's original paper has been cited nearly 3000 times, and dredging through that for the good bits is a lot more work than I'm willing to put in. This is just a summary of the interesting stuff I found on my limited, partial dig through the literature.\n\n\n# Thinking, inherently fast and inherently slow\n\nFrederick's original Cognitive Reflection Test paper describes the System 1/System 2 divide in the following way:\n\n> Recognizing that the face of the person entering the classroom belongs to your math teacher involves System 1 processes — it occurs instantly and effortlessly and is unaffected by intellect, alertness, motivation or the difficulty of the math problem being attempted at the time. Conversely, finding $\\sqrt{19163}$ to two decimal places without a calculator involves System 2 processes — mental operations requiring effort, motivation, concentration, and the execution of learned rules.\n\nI find it interesting that he frames mental processes as being *inherently* effortless or effortful, independent of the person doing the thinking. This is not quite true even for the examples he gives — faceblind people and calculating prodigies exist.\n\nThis framing is important for interpreting the CRT. If the problem inherently has a wrong 'System 1 solution' and a correct 'System 2 solution', the CRT can work as intended, as an efficient tool to split people by their propensity to use one strategy or the other. If there are 'System 1' ways to get the correct answer, the whole thing gets much more muddled, and it's hard to disentangle natural propensity to reflection from prior exposure to the right mathematical concepts.\n\nMy tentative guess is that the bat and ball problem *is* close to being this kind of efficient tool. Although in some ways it's the simplest of the three problems, solving it in a 'fast', 'intuitive' way relies on seeing the problem in a way that most people's education won't have provided. (I *think* this is true, anyway - I'll go into more detail later.) I suspect that this is less true the other two problems - ratios and exponential growth are topics that a mathematical or scientific education is more likely to build intuition for. \n\n(Aside: I'd like to know how these other two problems were chosen. The paper just states the following: \n\n> Motivated by this result [the answers to the bat and ball question], two other problems found to yield impulsive erroneous responses were included with the “bat and ball” problem to form a simple, three-item “Cognitive Reflection Test” (CRT), shown in Figure 1.\n\nI have a vague suspicion that Frederick trawled through something like 'The Bumper Book of Annoying Riddles' to find some brainteasers that don't require too much in the way of mathematical prerequisites. The lilypads one has a family resemblance to the classic [grains-of-wheat-on-a-chessboard puzzle][wheat], for instance.)\n\nHowever, I haven't found any great evidence either way for this guess. The original paper doesn't break down participants' scores by question – it just gives mean scores on the test as a whole. I did however find [this meta-analysis of 118 CRT studies][meta], which shows that the bat and ball question is the most difficult on average – only 32% of all participants get it right, compared with 40% for the widgets and 48% for the lilypads. It also has the biggest jump in success rate when comparing university students with non-students. That looks like better mathematical education does help on the bat and ball, but it doesn't clear up how it helps. It could improve participants' ability to intuitively see the answer. Or it could improve ability to come up with an 'unintuitive' solution, like solving the corresponding simultaneous equations by a rote method. \n\nWhat I'd really like is some insight into what individual people *actually do* when they try to solve the problems, rather than just this aggregate statistical information. I haven't found exactly what I wanted, but I did turn up a few interesting studies on the way.\n\n[meta]:https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/68049/1/MPRA_paper_68049.pdf\n[wheat]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem\n\n\n# No, seriously, the answer isn't ten cents\n\nMy favourite thing I found was [this (apparently unpublished) ‘extremely rough draft’][meyer] by Meyer, Spunt and Frederick from 2013, revisiting the bat and ball problem. The intuitive-but-wrong answer turns out to be *extremely* sticky, and the paper is basically a series of increasingly desperate attempts to get people to actually think about the question.\n\nOne conjecture for what people are doing when they get this question wrong is the *attribute substitution hypothesis*. This was [suggested early on by Kahneman and Frederick][kf2002], and is a fancy way of saying that they are instead solving the following simpler problem:\n\n> (1) A bat and a ball cost \\$1.10 in total. The bat costs \\$1.00. \n\n> How much does the ball cost? _____ cents\n\nNotice that this is missing the 'more than the ball' clause at the end, turning the question into a much simpler arithmetic problem. This simple problem *does* have 'ten cents' as the answer, so it's very plausible that people are getting confused by it. \n\nMeyer, Spunt and Frederick tested this hypothesis by getting respondents to recall the problem from memory. This showed a clear difference: 94% of 'five cent' respondents could recall the correct question, but only 61% of 'ten cent' respondents. It's possible that there is a different common cause of both the 'ten cent' response and misremembering the question, but it at least gives some support for the substitution hypothesis.\n\nHowever, getting people to actually answer the question correctly was a much more difficult problem. First they tried  bolding the words **more than the ball** to make this clause more salient. This made surprisingly little impact: 29% of respondents solved it, compared with 24% for the original problem. Printing both versions was slightly more successful, bumping up the correct response to 35%, but it was still a small effect.\n\nAfter this, they ditched subtlety and resorted to pasting these huge warnings above the question:\n\n![Computation warning: 'Be careful! Many people miss the following problem because they do not take the time to check their answer. Comprehension warning: 'Be careful! Many people miss the following problem because they read it too quickly and actually answer a different question than the one that was asked.'](https://drossbucket.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/bat_and_ball.png)\n\nThese were still only mildly effective, with a correct solution jumping to 50% from 45%. People just really like the answer 'ten cents', it seems.\n\nAt this point they completely gave up and just flat out added “HINT: 10 cents is not the answer.” This worked reasonably well, though there was still a hard core of 13% who persisted in writing down 'ten cents'. \n\nThat's where they left it. At this point there's not really any room to escalate beyond confiscating the respondents' pens and prefilling in the answer 'five cents', and I worry that somebody would still try and scratch in 'ten cents' in their own blood. The wrong answer is just incredibly compelling.\n\n\n[meyer]:https://law.yale.edu/system/files/area/workshop/leo/document/Frederick_Bat-BallProblem.pdf\n[kf2002]:https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/853c/2304f0b6455f27677023e19ffc30dc6ca683.pdf\n\n\n# So, what *are* people doing when they solve this problem?\n\nUnfortunately, it's hard to tell from the published literature (or at least what I found of it). What I'd really like is lots of transcripts of individuals talking through their problem solving process. The closest I found was [this paper][szaszi] by Szaszi et al, who did carry out these sort of interview, but it doesn't include any examples of individual responses. Instead, it gives a aggregated overview of types of responses, which doesn't go into the kind of detail I'd like. \n\n[szaszi]:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2017.1292954\n\n\nStill, the examples given for their response categories give a few clues. The categories are:\n\n- **Correct answer, correct start.** Example given: 'I see. This is an equation. Thus if the ball equals to x, the bat equals to x plus 1... '\n\n- **Correct answer, incorrect start.** Example: 'I would say 10 cents... But this cannot be true as it does not sum up to €1.10...'\n\n- **Incorrect answer, reflective**, i.e. some effort was made to reconsider the answer given, even if it was ultimately incorrect. Example: '... but I'm not sure... If together they cost €1.10, and the bat costs €1 more than the ball... the solution should be 10 cents. I'm done.'\n\n- **No reflection.** Example: 'Ok. I'm done.' \n\nThese demonstrate one way to reason your way to the correct answer (solve the simultaneous equations) and one way to be wrong (just blurt out the answer). They also demonstrate one way to recover from an incorrect solution (think about the answer you blurted out and see if it actually works). Still, it's all rather abstract and high level.\n\n# How To Solve It\n\nHowever, I did manage to stumble onto another source of insight. While researching the problem I came across [this article][ferrari] from the online magazine of the Association for Psychological Science, which discusses a variant 'Ford and Ferrari problem'. This is quite interesting in itself, but I was most excited by the comments section. Finally some examples of how the problem is solved in the wild!\n\n[ferrari]:https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/a-new-twist-on-a-classic-puzzle.html\n\n\nThe simplest 'analytical', 'System 2' solution is to rewrite the problem as two simultaneous linear equations and plug-and-chug your way to the correct answer. For example, writing $B$ for the bat and $b$ for the ball, we get the two equations\n\n$B + b = 110$,\n$B - b = 100$, \n\nwhich we could then solve in various standard ways, e.g.\n\n$2B = 210$,\n$B = 105$,\n\nwhich then gives\n\n$b = 110 - B = 5$.\n\nThere are a couple of variants of this explained in the comments. It's a very reliable way to tackle the problem: if you already know how to do this sort of rote method, there are no surprises. This sort of method would work for any similar problem involving linear equations.\n\nHowever, it's pretty obvious that a lot of people *won't* have access to this method. Plenty of people noped out of mathematics long before they got to simultaneous equations, so they won't be able to solve it this way. What might be less obvious, at least if you mostly live in a high-maths-ability bubble, is that these people may also be missing the sort of tacit mathematical background that would even allow them to frame the problem in a useful form in the first place.\n\nThat sounds a bit abstract, so let's look at some responses (I'll paste all these straight in, so any typos are in the original). First, we have these two confused commenters: \n\n> The thing is, why does the ball have to be \\$.05? It could have been .04 0r.03 and the bat would still cost more than \\$1.\n\nand\n\n> This is exactly what bothers me and resulted in me wanting to look up the question online. On the quiz the other 2 questions were definitive. This one technically could have more than one answer so this is where phycologists actually mess up when trying to give us a trick question. The ball at .4 and the bat at 1.06 doesn’t break the rule either.\n\nThese commenters don't automatically see two equations in two variables that together are enough to constrain the problem. Instead they seem to focus mainly on the first condition (adding up to \\$1.10) and just use the second one as a vague check at best ('the bat would still cost more than \\$1'). This means that they are unable to immediately tell that the problem has a unique solution.\n\nIn response, another commenter, Tony, suggests a correct solution which is an interesting mix of writing the problem out formally and then figuring out the answer by trial and error:\\\n\n>  I hear your pain. I feel as though psychologists and psychiatrists get together every now and then to prove how stoopid I am. However, after more than a little head scratching I’ve gained an understanding of this puzzle. It can be expressed as two facts and a question A=100+B and A+B=110, so B=? If B=2 then the solution would be 100+2+2 and A+B would be 104. If B=6 then the solution would be 100+6+6 and A+B would be 112. But as be KNOW A+B=110 the only number for B on it’s own is 5.\n\nThis suggests enough half-remembered mathematical knowledge to find a sensible abstract framing, but not enough to solve it the standard way. \n\nFinally, commenter Marlo Eugene provides an ingenious way of solving the problem without writing all the algebraic steps out:\n\n> Linguistics makes all the difference. The conceptual emphasis seems to lie within the word MORE.\n\n> X + Y = \\$1.10. If X = \\$1 MORE then that leaves \\$0.10 TO WORK WITH rather than automatically assign to Y\n\n> So you divide the remainder equally (assuming negative values are disqualified) and get 0.05.\n\nSo even this small sample of comments suggests a wide diversity of problem-solving methods leading to the two common answers. Further, these solutions don't all split neatly into 'System 1' 'intuitive' and 'System 2' 'analytic'. Marlo Eugene's solution, for instance, is a mixed solution of writing the equations down in a formal way, but then finding a clever way of just seeing the answer rather than solving them by rote.\n\nI'd still appreciate more detailed transcripts, including the time taken to solve the problem. My suspicion is still that very few people solve this problem with a fast intuitive response, in the way that I rapidly see the correct answer to the lilypad question. Even the more 'intuitive' responses, like Marlo Eugene's, seem to rely on some initial careful reflection and a good initial framing of the problem.\n\nIf I'm correct about this lack of fast responses, my tentative guess for the reason is that it has something to do with the way most of us learn simultaneous equations in school. We generally learn arithmetic as young children in a fairly concrete way, with the formal numerical problems supplemented with lots of specific examples of adding up apples and bananas and so forth.\n\nBut then, for some reason, this goes completely out of the window once the unknown quantity isn't sitting on its own on one side of the equals sign. This is instead hived off into its own separate subject, called 'algebra', and the rules are taught much later in a much more formalised style, without much attempt to build up intuition first.  \n\n(One exception is the sort of puzzle sheets that are often given to young kids, where the unknowns are just empty boxes to be filled in. Sometimes you get 2+3=□, sometimes it's 2+□=5, but either way you go about the same process of using your wits to figure out the answer. Then, for some reason I'll never understand, the worksheets get put away and the poor kids don't see the subject again until years later, when the box is now called $x$ for some reason and you have to find the answer by defined rules. Anyway, this is a separate rant.)\n\nThis lack of a rich background in puzzling out the answer to specific concrete problems means most of us lean hard on formal rules in this domain, even if we're relatively mathematically sophisticated. Only a few build up the necessary repertoire of tricks to solve the problem quickly by insight. I'm reminded of a story in Feynman's *The Pleasure of Finding Things Out*:\n\n> Around that time my cousin, who was three years older, was in high school. He was having considerable difficulty with his algebra, so a tutor would come. I was allowed to sit in a corner while the tutor would try to teach my cousin algebra. I'd hear him talking about x.\n\n> I said to my cousin, \"What are you trying to do?\"\n\n> \"I'm trying to find out what x is, like in 2x + 7 = 15.\"\n\n> I say, \"You mean 4.\"\n\n> \"Yeah, but you did it by arithmetic. You have to do it by algebra.\"\n\n> I learned algebra, fortunately, not by going to school, but by finding my aunt's old schoolbook in the attic, and understanding that the whole idea was to find out what *x* is - it doesn't make any difference how you do it.\n\nI think this reliance on formal methods might be somewhat less true for exponential growth and ratios, the subjects underpinning the lilypad and widget questions. Certainly I seem to have better intuition there, without having to resort to rote calculation. But I'm not sure how general this is.\n\n\n# How To Visualise It\n\nIf you wanted to solve the bat and ball problem without having to 'do it by algebra', how would you go about it? \n\nMy [original post][stupid] on the problem was a pretty quick, throwaway job, but over time it picked up some truly excellent comments by anders and Kyzentun, which really start to dig into the structure of the problem and suggest ways to 'just see' the answer. The thread with anders in particular goes into lots of other examples of how we think through solving various problems, and is well worth reading in full. I'll only summarise the bat-and-ball-related parts of the comments here.\n\nWe all used some variant of the method suggested by Marlo Eugene in the comments above. Writing out the basic problem again, we have:\n\n$B + b = 110$,\n$B - b = 100$.\n\nNow, instead of immediately jumping to the standard method of eliminating one of the variables, we can just look at what these two equations are saying and solve it directly 'by thinking'. We have a bat, $B$. If you add the price of the ball, $b$, you get 110 cents. If you instead remove the same quantity $b$ you get 100 cents. So the bat's price must be exactly halfway between these two numbers, at 105 cents. That leaves five for the ball.\n\nNow that I'm thinking of the problem in this way, I directly see the equations as being 'about a bat that's halfway between 100 and 110 cents', and the answer is incredibly obvious. \n\nKyzentun suggests a variant on the problem that is much less counterintuitive than the original:\n\n> A centered piece of text and its margins are 110 columns wide. The text is 100 columns wide. How wide is one margin?\n\n> Same numbers, same mathematical formula to reach the solution. But less misleading because you know there are two margins, and thus know to divide by two after subtracting.\n\nIn the original problem, the 110 units and 100 units both refer to something abstract, the sum and difference of the bat and ball. In Kyzentun's version these become much more concrete objects, the width of the text and the total width of the margins. The work of seeing the equations as relating to something concrete has mostly been done for you.\n\nSimilarly, anders works the problem by 'getting rid of the 100 cents', and splitting the remainder in half to get at the price of the ball: \n\n> I just had an easy time with #1 which I haven’t before. What I did was take away the difference so that all the items are the same (subtract 100), evenly divide the remainder among the items (divide 10 by 2) and then add the residuals back on to get 105 and 5.\n\n> The heuristic I seem to be using is to treat objects as made up of a value plus a residual. So when they gave me the residual my next thought was “now all the objects are the same, so whatever I do to one I do to all of them”.\n\nI think that after reasoning my way through all these perspectives, I'm finally at the point where I have a quick, 'intuitive' understanding of the problem. But it's surprising how much work it was for such a simple bit of algebra.\n\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nRather than making any big conclusions, the main thing I wanted to demonstrate in this post is how *complicated* the story gets when you look at one problem in detail. I've written about [close reading][close] recently, and this has been something like a close reading of the bat and ball problem.\n\nFrederick's original paper on the Cognitive Reflection Test is in that generic social science style where you define a new metric and then see how it correlates with a bunch of other macroscale factors (either big social categories like gender or education level, or the results of other statistical tests that try to measure factors like time preference or risk preference). There's a strange indifference to the details of the test itself – at no point does he discuss why he picked those specific three questions, and there's no attempt to model what was making the intuitive-but-wrong answer appealing. \n\nThe later paper by Meyer, Spunt and Frederick is much more interesting to me, because it really starts to pick apart the specifics of the bat and ball problem. Is an easier question getting substituted? Can participants reproduce the correct question from memory? \n\nI learned the most from the individual responses, though. This is where you really get to see the variety of ways that people tackle the problem. Careful reflection definitely seems to improve the chance of a correct answer in general, but many of the responses don't really fit the neat 'fast vs slow' division of the original setup.\n\n\n[close]:https://drossbucket.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/a-braindump-on-derrida-and-close-reading/\n\n\n# Questions\n\nI'm interested in any comments on the post, but here are a few specific things I'd like to get your answers to:\n\n-  My rapid, intuitive answer for the bat and ball question is wrong (at least until I retrained it by thinking about the problem way too much). However, for the other two I 'just see' the correct answer. Is this common for other people, or do you have a different split?\n\n- If you're able to rapidly 'just see' the answer to the bat and ball question, how do you do it? \n\n- How do people go about designing tests like these? This isn't at all my field and I'd be interested in any good sources. I'd kind of assumed that there'd be some kind of serious-business Test Creation Methodology, but for the CRT at least it looks like people just noticed they got surprising answers for the bat and ball question and looked around for similar questions. Is that unusual compared to other psychological tests?"

      "markdown": "The most common [formalizations of Occam's Razor](/lw/jp/occams_razor/), Solomonoff induction and Minimum Description Length, measure the program size of a computation used in a hypothesis, but don't measure the running time or space requirements of the computation.  What if this makes a mind vulnerable to finite forms of Pascal's Wager?  A compactly specified wager can grow in size _much_ faster than it grows in complexity.  The utility of a Turing machine can grow much faster than its prior probability shrinks.\n\nConsider [Knuth's up-arrow notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation):\n\n*   3^3 = 3\\*3\\*3 = 27\n*   3^^3 = (3^(3^3)) = 3^27 = 3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3\\*3 = 7625597484987\n*   3^^^3 = (3^^(3^^3)) = 3^^7625597484987 = 3^(3^(3^(... 7625597484987 times ...)))\n\nIn other words:  3^^^3 describes an exponential tower of threes 7625597484987 layers tall.  Since this number can be computed by a simple Turing machine, it contains very little information and requires a very short message to describe.  This, even though writing out 3^^^3 in base 10 would require _enormously_ more writing material than there are atoms in the known universe (a paltry 10^80).\n\nNow suppose someone comes to me and says, \"Give me five dollars, or I'll use my magic powers from outside the Matrix to run a Turing machine that simulates and kills 3^^^^3 people.\"\n\nCall this Pascal's Mugging.\n\n\"Magic powers from outside the Matrix\" are easier said than done - we have to suppose that our world is a computing simulation run from within an environment that can afford simulation of arbitrarily large finite Turing machines, and that the would-be wizard has been spliced into our own Turing tape and is in continuing communication with an outside operator, etc.\n\nThus the Kolmogorov complexity of \"magic powers from outside the Matrix\" is larger than the mere English words would indicate.  Therefore the Solomonoff-inducted probability, two to the _negative_ Kolmogorov complexity, is exponentially tinier than one might naively think.\n\nBut, small as this probability is, it isn't anywhere _near_ as small as 3^^^^3 is large.  If you take a decimal point, followed by a number of zeros equal to the length of the Bible, followed by a 1, and multiply this unimaginably tiny fraction by 3^^^^3, the result is pretty much 3^^^^3.\n\nMost people, I think, envision an \"infinite\" God that is nowhere near as large as 3^^^^3.  \"Infinity\" is reassuringly featureless and blank.  \"Eternal life in Heaven\" is nowhere near as intimidating as the thought of spending 3^^^^3 years on one of those fluffy clouds.  The notion that the diversity of life on Earth springs from God's infinite creativity, sounds more plausible than the notion that life on Earth was created by a superintelligence 3^^^^3 bits large.  Similarly for envisioning an \"infinite\" God interested in whether women wear men's clothing, versus a superintelligence of 3^^^^3 bits, etc.\n\nThe original version of Pascal's Wager is easily dealt with by the gigantic multiplicity of possible gods, an Allah for every Christ and a Zeus for every Allah, including the \"Professor God\" who places only atheists in Heaven.   And since all the expected utilities here are allegedly \"[infinite](http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf)\", it's easy enough to argue that they cancel out.  Infinities, being featureless and blank, are all the same size.\n\nBut suppose I built an AI which worked by some bounded analogue of Solomonoff induction - an AI sufficiently Bayesian to insist on calculating complexities and assessing probabilities, rather than just waving them off as \"large\" or \"small\".\n\nIf the probabilities of various scenarios considered did not _exactly_ cancel out, the AI's action in the case of Pascal's Mugging would be _overwhelmingly_ dominated by whatever tiny differentials existed in the various tiny probabilities under which 3^^^^3 units of expected utility were actually at stake.\n\nYou or I would probably wave off the whole matter with a laugh, planning according to the dominant mainline probability:  Pascal's Mugger is just a philosopher out for a fast buck.\n\nBut a silicon chip does not look over the code fed to it, assess it for reasonableness, and correct it if not.  An AI is not given its code like a human servant given instructions.  An AI _is_ its code.  What if a philosopher tries Pascal's Mugging on the AI for a joke, and the tiny probabilities of 3^^^^3 lives being at stake, override _everything_ else in the AI's calculations?   What is the mere Earth at stake, compared to a tiny probability of 3^^^^3 lives?\n\nHow do _I_ know to be worried by this line of reasoning?  How do _I_ know to [rationalize](/lw/ju/rationalization/) reasons a Bayesian shouldn't work that way?  A mind that worked strictly by Solomonoff induction would not know to rationalize reasons that Pascal's Mugging mattered less than Earth's existence.  It would simply go by whatever answer Solomonoff induction obtained.\n\nIt would seem, then, that I've implicitly declared my existence as a mind that does not work by the logic of Solomonoff, at least not the way I've described it.  What am I comparing Solomonoff's answer to, to determine whether Solomonoff induction got it \"right\" or \"wrong\"?\n\nWhy do I think it's unreasonable to focus my entire attention on the magic-bearing possible worlds, faced with a Pascal's Mugging?  Do I have an instinct to resist exploitation by arguments \"anyone could make\"?  Am I unsatisfied by any visualization in which the dominant mainline probability leads to a loss?  Do I drop sufficiently small probabilities from consideration entirely?  Would an AI that lacks these instincts be exploitable by Pascal's Mugging?\n\nIs it me who's wrong?  Should I worry more about the possibility of some Unseen Magical Prankster of very tiny probability taking this post literally, than about the fate of the human species in the \"mainline\" probabilities?\n\nIt doesn't feel to me like 3^^^^3 lives are _really_ at stake, even at very tiny probability.  I'd sooner question my grasp of \"rationality\" than give five dollars to a Pascal's Mugger because I thought it was \"rational\".\n\nShould we penalize computations with large space and time requirements?  This is a hack that solves the problem, but is it _true?_ Are computationally costly explanations less likely?  Should I think the universe is probably a coarse-grained simulation of my mind rather than real quantum physics, because a coarse-grained human mind is _exponentially_ cheaper than real quantum physics?  Should I think the galaxies are tiny lights on a painted backdrop, because that Turing machine would require less space to compute?\n\nGiven that, in general, a Turing machine can increase in utility vastly faster than it increases in complexity, how should an Occam-abiding mind avoid being dominated by tiny probabilities of vast utilities?\n\nIf I could formalize whichever internal criterion was telling me I didn't want this to happen, I might have an answer.\n\nI talked over a variant of this problem with Nick Hay, Peter de Blanc, and Marcello Herreshoff in summer of 2006.  I don't feel I have a satisfactory resolution as yet, so I'm throwing it open to any analytic philosophers who might happen to read Overcoming Bias."

You come to me and point out the differences between life-death and wake-sleep, all so that you can avoid making the obvious generalization that you prefer to deny.  Yet if we allow such reasoning as this, will not software project managers say, 'My project is different from yours, because I have better programmers'?  And will not [textbook authors](/lw/jh/kahnemans_planning_anecdote/) say, \"We are wiser than those other textbook authors, and therefore we will finish sooner'?  Therefore you can see that to point out the similarities between things is superior, and to point out the differences between them, inferior.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"You say that your reasoning is like to [the reasoning of Daniel Kahneman](/lw/jh/kahnemans_planning_anecdote/), yet it seems to me that they are importantly different.  For Daniel Kahneman dealt with generalization over things that are almost quite as similar to each other, as different flippings of the same coin.  Yet you deal with wholly different processes with different internal mechanisms, and try to generalize across one to the other.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"But Phaecrinon, now you only compound your error; for you have pointed out the difference between myself and Kahneman, where I have pointed out the similarity.  And this is again inferior, by reason of the inferiority of the Inside View over the Outside View.  You have only given me one more special reason why the Outside View should not apply to _your_ particular case - all so that you can deny that our souls exist in the house of Hades.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Yet Plato, if you propose indiscriminately to apply the Outside View to all things, how do you explain the ability of engineers to construct a new bridge that is unlike any other bridge, and calculate its properties in advance by computer simulation?  How can the Wright Flyer fly, when all previous human-made flying machines had failed?  How indeed can anything at all happen for the first time?\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"Perhaps sometimes things do happen for the first time, but this does not mean we can predict them.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Ah, Plato, you do too little justice to engineers. Out of all the possible structures of metal and tubes and explosive fuel, very few such structures constitute a spaceship that will land on the Moon.  To land on the Moon for the first time, then, human engineers must have known, in advance, which of many designs would have the exceedingly rare property of landing upon the Moon.  And is this not the very activity that engineers perform - calculating questions _in detail?_  Do not engineers take the Inside View with great success?\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"But they assume that _each screw and part_ will behave just like it does on all the other times observed.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"That is so.  Yet nonetheless they construct detailed internal models of exceeding complexity, and do _not_ only collect the statistics of whole cases.  This is the Inside View if anything is the Inside View; no one claims that Inside Views are generated purely from nothingness.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"Then I answer that when engineers have shown many times their ability to perform detailed calculations with success, we trust on future occasions that they will succeed similarly.  We trust the Inside View when the Outside View tells us to trust the Inside View.  But if this is not so, and there is not a past record of success with detailed calculations, then the Outside View is all that is left to us; and we should foresake all attempts at internal modeling, for they will only lead us astray.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"But now you have admitted that the notion of 'trust Outside View, distrust Inside View' has a limited _domain of applicability_, and we may as well restrict that domain further.  Just as you try to seal off the _successes_ of engineers from the Outside View, so too, I wish to seal off the _failures_ of Greek philosophers from the Outside View.  Specifically, the record of Greek philosophers does not inspire in me any confidence that the Outside View can be applied across processes with greatly different internal causal structures, like life-and-death versus sleeping-and-waking.  Daniel Kahneman and his fellows, writing a textbook, encountered a challenge drawn from a _structurally_ similar _causal generator_ as many other cases of textbook-writing; subject to just the same sort of unforeseen delays.  Likewise the students who failed to predict when they would finish their Christmas shopping; the task of Christmas shopping does not change so much from one Christmas to another.  It would be another matter entirely to say, 'Each year I have finished my Christmas shopping one day before Christmas - therefore I expect to finish my textbook one day before my deadline.'\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"But this only sounds foolish, because we _know_ from the Outside View that textbooks are delayed far longer than this. Perhaps if you had _never_ written a textbook before, and neither had anyone else, 'one day before deadline' would be the most reasonable estimate.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"You would not allow me to predict in advance that textbook writing is more difficult than Christmas shopping?\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"No.  For you have chosen this _particular_ special plea, using your hindsight of the correct answer.  If you had truly needed to write a textbook for the first time in history, you would have pled, 'No one can foresee driving delays and crowds in the store, but the work I do to write a textbook is all under my own control - therefore, I will finish _more_ than one day before deadline.'\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"But even you admit that to draw analogies across wider and wider differences is to make those analogies less and less reliable.  If you see many different humans sleeping, you can conclude that a newly observed human will probably sleep for eight hours; but if you see a cat sleeping, you must be less confident; and if you wish to draw an analogy to life and death, that is a greater distance still.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"If I allow that, will not software project managers say, 'My software project is as unlike to all other software projects as is a cat to a human?'\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Then they are fools and nothing can be done about it.  Surely you do not think that the prediction from many humans to one cat is _just as strong_ as the prediction from many humans to one human?  Insensitivity to the reliability of predictors is also a standard bias.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"That is true.  Yet an Outside View may not be a _good_ estimate, and yet still be the _best_ estimate.  If we have only seen the sleep cycles of many humans, then the Outside View on the whole group may be the _best_ estimate for a newly observed cat, if you have no other data.  Even likewise with our guesses as to life and death.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"And one sign of when the Outside View might not provide a good estimate, is when there are many different reference classes to which you might compare your new thing.  A candle burns low, and exhausts itself and extinguishes, and does not light again the next day. How do you know that life and death is not analogous to a candle which burns and fails?  Why not generalize over the similarity to a candle, rather than the similarity to sleep cycles?\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"Oh, but Phaecrinon, if we allow arguments over reference classes, we may as well toss the notion of an Outside View out the window.  For then software project managers will say that the proper reference class for _their_ project is the class of projects that delivered on time, or the class of projects with managers as wise as themselves.  As for your analogy of the candle, it is self-evident that life is similar to sleeping and waking, not to candles.  When a man is born, he is weak, but he grows to adulthood and is strong, and then with age he grows weaker again.  In this he is like the Sun, that is weak when it rises, and strong at its apex, and then sinks below the horizon; in this a man is like the sleepy riser, who becomes sleepy again at the end of the day.  It is self-evident that life and death belongs to the class of cyclical processes, and not the class of irreversible processes.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"What is self-evident to you does not seem so self-evident to me, Plato; and just because you call several widely different things 'cyclical processes', it does not follow that they were all random samples drawn from a great Barrel of Cyclical Processes, and that the next thing you choose to call a 'cyclical process' will have the same distribution of properties.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"Again you compound your mistake by pleading special exceptions.  Will we let the software manager plead that his project is not drawn from the same barrel as the others?\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Again you extend the Outside View beyond its domain of applicability.  In engineering where all internal parts are precisely understood, but the whole is not quite similar to anything else that has been built before, then the Inside View is superior to the Outside View.  And the sign of this is that results are routinely predicted in advance with great precision.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"This is just to say that when the Outside View tells us to use the Inside View, we should use it.  But surely not otherwise, Phaecrinon!\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"When many different people try to accomplish the same task, and the internal details cannot be precisely calculated, and yet people have a tendency to optimism and to not visualize incidental catastrophes, _then_ the Outside View is superior to the Inside View.  And the sign of this is that the same kind of task - with the same sort of internal structure, the same difficulties and challenges - has been done many times, and the result cannot be predicted with precision; yet people's predictions are usually biased optimistically.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"This is the triumph of the Outside View!\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"But when you deal with attempted analogies across _structually different_ processes, perhaps unique or poorly understood, then things which are similar in some surface respects are often different in other respects.  And the sign of _this_ domain is that when people try to reason by similarity, it is not at all clear what is similar to what, or which surface resemblances they should focus upon as opposed to others.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"_I_ think the resemblance of life-death to sleep-waking is perfectly clear.  But what do _you_ assert we should do in such a case, if it is not taking the Outside View?\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Perhaps there is nothing to be done at all, with either the Inside View or the Outside View.  Not all problems are solvable; and it may be that the best we can do is avoid the overconfidence from asserting that analogies are much stronger than they are.  But it seems to me that _in_ those cases where we know something of the internal structure, then we can sometimes produce predictions by imagining the internals, even though the whole thing is not similar to any other whole thing in our experience.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"Now I challenge _you_ to consider how well such thoughts have done, historically.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"What I have just described is the way that engineers build the first prototype of anything.  But that, I admit, is when they understand very precisely the parts they use.  If the internals are not well-understood, then the whole will in most cases be even less well-understood.  It is only your idea that the Outside View can yield _better_ predictions, that I am protesting against.  It seems to me that the result of taking the Outside View of things poorly understood or structurally dissimilar to other things in the purported reference class, is only to create great disputes about [definitional boundaries](/lw/o0/where_to_draw_the_boundary/), and clashing analogies, and arguments over which surface similarities are important.  When all along the new process may not be similar to _anything_ that already exists.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"But there is no alternative to the Outside View.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Yes, there is; you can try to imagine the internal process, if you know anything at all about it.  At least then two people can focus on the internal structure and argue about _what happens_ and their dispute will be commensurable.  But if two people both say 'I am taking the Outside View' and then form different 'self-evident' reference classes, what do they do from there?  How can they resolve their dispute about which surface characteristics are important?  At least if you make predictions about internal causal processes, the results are finally testable if the dispute is empirical at all.  How do you test the assertion that life is _more importantly similar_ to sleep and waking, than to a candle?  Perhaps life is simply like neither.  _Something_ must happen internally when a human thinks and reasons, but there does _not_ have to exist _any_ other process in nature similar enough that we could predict the characteristics of human thought by looking at it.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"What it boils down to, is that you are constructing a detailed excuse not to use the Outside View in your own case.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"And if each of two people with different Outside Views says to the other, 'You are a fool, for disregarding the Outside View!' then they will make no progress on their disagreement at all.  This is the danger of proposing an absolute mandate for philosophers encountering new and structurally different phenomena, because you want to prevent software project managers from making special excuses for their software project.  Reversed stupidity is not intelligence, and there is no language in which it is difficult to write bad computer programs, and in the art of rationality it is never difficult to shoot off your own foot if you desire to do so.  The standard Outside View relies on your seeing the common-sense difference between textbook writing and Christmas shopping, so that you don't try to lump them into the same reference class.  I am similarly hoping that you can see by common sense that the Outside View works rather better to predict Christmas shopping times, than what you are arguing is the analogous 'Outside View' technique in philosophy.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"And _you_ believe you can do better with the Inside View.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"Reasoning about the internals of things whose output is not yet observed, is fraught with difficulty.  One must be constantly aware of what one can and cannot reasonably guess, based on the strength of your knowledge.  The uncertainties of such an Inside View, end up being much greater than the uncertainties of the Outside View _on Christmas shopping_.  Only when the Inside View support appears extremely lopsided can you dare to come to even a tentative conclusion!  But I _do_ think that sometimes the Inside View support can be extremely lopsided - though it is a strain on your rationality even to correctly distinguish such cases.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"The evidence shows that people cannot successfully use the Inside View at all.\"\n> \n> Phaecrinon:  \"No, the evidence shows that the Outside View yields _better_ answers than the Inside View for problems like writing a textbook.  But even an Inside View of writing a textbook would tell you that the project was unlikely to destroy the Earth.  Taking the Inside View of a new and strange process is a Difficult Problem, where taking the Outside View on textbook composition is a Straightforward Problem.  But to try and argue like alchemists from surface resemblances is a Hopeless Problem.  Then there cannot even be any meeting of minds, if you start with different assumptions about which similarities are important.  An answer need not exist even in principle, for there may be _nothing_ else that is enough like this new thing to yield _successful_ predictions by analogy.\"\n> \n> Plato:  \"So you have said that it is easier for two people to conduct their dispute if they both take the Inside View and argue about internal causal processes.  But from this it does not follow that the Outside View based on surface resemblances is inferior.  Perhaps you are only coming to agreement on folly, and either of two conflicting Outside Views would be more reliable than the best Inside View.\""

An outside view works best when using a reference class with a <em>similar causal structure</em> to the thing you're trying to predict. An inside view works best when a phenomenon's causal structure is well-understood, and when (to your knowledge) there are very few phenomena with a similar causal structure that you can use to predict things about the phenomenon you're investigating.

Some things aren't very predictable with <em>either</em> an outside view or an inside view.

I was treating shares as if they were worth some fixed amount of money.</p><p>The simplest explanation for why you can’t just model shares as being worth fixed amounts of money is that people are risk averse, and so the tenth Google share you buy is worth less to you than the first; and so as the price decreases, it becomes more worthwhile to take a bigger risk on the company.</p><p>As a result, divestment reduces the price of shares, in the same way that selling anything else reduces its price.</p><p>In the specific case of divestment, this means that when I sell some stocks, the price ends up lower than it was.</p><p>I first learned I was wrong about this from <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2019/05/25/analyzing-divestment/\">this Sideways View post</a>, published May 2019.</p><h2 id=\"2__Index_funds\">2. Index funds</h2><p>I used to think that it wasn’t possible for individuals like me to get higher returns than I’d get from just buying an index fund, because in an efficient market, every share is equally valuable.</p><p>This is wrong for a few reasons. One is that the prices of shares are determined by the risk aversion of other market participants; if your risk aversion is different from the average, some shares (specifically, risky ones) will be much better investments than others.</p><p>Secondly, because I’m risk averse, I prefer buying shares which are going to do relatively well in worlds where I’m relatively poorer. For example, if I’m a software engineer at a tech company, compared to a random shareholder I should invest more in companies which are as anticorrelated with software engineer salaries as possible. Or if I live in the US, I should consider investing in the markets of other countries.</p><p>I didn’t understand this fully until around April this year.</p><h2 id=\"3__Prediction_markets\">3. Prediction markets</h2><p>Relatedly, I thought that the fair market price of a contract which pays out $1 if Trump gets elected is just the probability of Trump getting elected. This is wrong because Trump getting elected is correlated with how valuable other assets are. Suppose I thought that Trump has a 50% chance of getting reelected, and that if he gets re-elected, the stock market will crash. If I have a bunch of my money in the stock market, the contract is worth more than 50 cents, because it hedges against Trump winning.</p><p>(Here’s a maybe more intuitive way of seeing this: Suppose I could pick between getting $10 in the world where Trump won (in which we’re assuming the market would crash) and the world where Trump lost. Clearly the $10 would be more valuable to me in the world where he wins and my stocks are decimated. So the value of the “Trump wins” contract is higher than the value of the “Trump loses” contract, even though they correspond to events of equal probability.) And there is a potentially very high number of correlative outcomes that betters might be thinking about and hedging against, and the market computes these and reflects them in the price. </p><p>This is a more general version of the point that it’s hard to have a prediction market on whether the world will end. Paul Christiano has an <a href=\"https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/risk-arbitrage/\">old blog post on this topic</a> which I first saw years ago but which I didn't understand properly at the time.</p><p>I first understood this fully around March this year.</p><p>All of these first three mistakes were the result of me not really understanding basic portfolio theory; thanks to spending a bunch of time talking to traders over the last few years, I now understand it better.</p><h2 id=\"4__Coase_s_arguments_about_externalities\">4. Coase’s arguments about externalities</h2><p>I used to have an overly simplistic picture of externalities—I believed the Econ 101 story: normally markets are efficient, but when a good has an externality the wrong amount will be produced, and this is resolved by putting a tax or subsidy on the good to internalize the externality.</p><p>I changed my mind about this after reading <a href=\"http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Coase_World.html\">David Friedman’s essay</a>. I’ll just quote a few paragraphs:</p><blockquote>The first step is to realize that an external cost is not simply a cost produced by the pollutor and born by the victim. In almost all cases, the cost is a result of decisions by both parties. I would not be coughing if your steel mill were not pouring out sulfur dioxide. But your steel mill would do no damage to me if I did not happen to live down wind from it. It is the joint decision—yours to pollute and mine to live where you are polluting—that produces the cost.</blockquote><blockquote>Suppose that, in a particular case, the pollution does $100,000 a year worth of damage and can be eliminated at a cost of only $80,000 a year (from here on, all costs are per year). Further assume that the cost of shifting all of the land down wind to a new use unaffected by the pollution—growing timber instead of renting out summer resorts, say—is only $50,000. If we impose an emission fee of a hundred thousand dollars a year, the steel mill stops polluting and the damage is eliminated—at a cost of $80,000. If we impose no emission fee the mill keeps polluting, the owners of the land stop advertising for tenants and plant trees instead, and the problem is again solved—at a cost of $50,000. In this case the result without Pigouvian taxes is efficient—the problem is eliminated at the lowest possible cost—and the result with Pigouvian taxes in inefficient.</blockquote><blockquote>Moving the victims may not be a very plausible solution in the case of air pollution; it seems fairly certain that even the most draconian limitations on emissions in southern California would be less expensive than evacuating that end of the state. But the problem of externalities applies to a wide range of different situations, in many of which it is far from obvious which party can avoid the problem at lower cost and in some of which it is not even obvious which one we should call the victim.</blockquote><p>My previous position was missing this nuance. I first read that David Friedman essay midway through last year.</p><h2 id=\"5__Non_tax_regulations_that_increase_equality_have_disincentive_effects_on_work\">5. Non-tax regulations that increase equality have disincentive effects on work</h2><p>I used to think that the way to decide whether a minimum wage was good was to look at the effect on unemployment and the effect on total income for minimum wage workers, and then figure out whether I thought that the increase in unemployment was worth the increase in income. I think this was wrong in two pretty different ways.</p><p>The first mistake is that I was neglecting the fact that policies aimed at transferring wealth from rich people to poor people disincentivize making money. Taxes are just a special case of this, and can be seen as part of a category of wealth-transferal policies that includes minimum wage. So when you’re arguing that a minimum wage would be part of the optimal policy portfolio, you have to argue that it would be better than a tax. I did not understand that this was part of the calculation.</p><p>I first learned this from a post by Paul Christiano which I think he incorporated into Objection 2 <a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2019/03/03/on-redistribution/\">here</a>; that blog post was published March 2019.</p><h2 id=\"6__Price_and_quality_controls\">6. Price and quality controls</h2><p>The second of the ways I was wrong about the minimum wage comes from a misunderstanding of the economics of price controls; in hindsight I think that my high school economics curriculum was just wrong about this. I think that I realized my misconception after reading <a href=\"https://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/dark-lords-answer/\">The Dark Lord’s Answer</a>, published in 2016.</p><p>In high school economics, I was taught that when the government imposes a price floor (e.g., a minimum wage), you’ll end up with more supply than demand for the good. This is beneficial to suppliers who still succeed at selling the good, it’s harmful to suppliers who can no longer sell the good, and it’s harmful to buyers.</p><p>I now think that that understanding was overly simplistic. Here’s my current understanding.</p><p>In a market, the supply and demand of a good must equilibrate somehow—for every loaf of bread that someone buys, someone had to sell a loaf of bread. One way that the market can equilibrate is that the price can change—if the price is higher, selling is more attractive and buying is less attractive. So if more people want to buy than sell at the current price, we might expect the price to rise until things are in equilibrium.</p><p>But there are other variables than price which can change in a way that allow the market to equilibrate. One obvious example is product quality—if you decrease the quality of a product, consumers are less enthusiastic about buying but suppliers are more enthusiastic about selling (because they can presumably make it for cheaper).</p><p>Often, fluctuations in quality rather than price are what cause markets to equilibrate. For example, restaurants often don’t have price hikes at busy times, they just have long waits. Customers like it less when they have to wait more, and restaurants like having customers waiting (because it helps them ensure that their restaurant is constantly full).</p><p>So when we talk about the equilibrium state of a market, we can’t just talk about price, we also need to talk about all the other variables which can change.</p><p>In the case where we only consider price and quantity, there’s always only one equilibrium, because as price increases, supply rises and demand falls. (Actually, supply and demand could be constant over some range of prices, in which case there is an interval of equilibrium prices. I’m going to ignore this.)</p><p>But if we’re allowed to vary quality too, there are now many possible settings of price and quality where supply equals demand. E.g., for any fixed quality level, there’s going to be one equilibrium price, for the same reason as before.</p><p>In a competitive market, the equilibrium will be the point on the supply-equals-demand curve which maximizes efficiency. E.g., if there’s a way that producers could increase quality that would make production cost $1 more, producers will only do that if it makes the product worth more than $1 more valuable to consumers. This is optimal.</p><p>(In real life, you usually have producers selling a variety of different similar goods at different price/quality points; I’m talking about this restricted case because it’s simpler.)</p><p>Now, suppose that the government imposes a restriction on price or quality. For example, they might set a maximum or minimum price, or they might make safety restrictions which restrict quality in certain ways. The market will reequilibriate by using whatever degrees of freedom it has left. Specifically, it will reequilibriate to the optimal point within the newly restricted space of points at which supply equals demand. In general, this will lead to a less efficient outcome.</p><p>For example, if the price of bread is $2 at equilibrium, and the government sets a maximum price of $1.50, then the equilibrium will move along the quality curve until it gets to the point where the equilibrium price is $1.50.</p><p>This analysis gets more realistic if you allow there to be more dimensions than price and quantity along which bread can vary. For example, I’d expect to see the following phenomena:</p><ul><li>Producers trying to figure out ways to get paid under the table, e.g., by demanding favors in return for selling to people. This reduces efficiency inasmuch as producers weren’t already being compensated by miscellaneous favors.</li><li>Sellers changing in ways that are mildly more convenient for them but much more inconvenient for consumers. For example, having long lines outside stores, or treating customers worse.</li><li>Producers indulging weak preferences of theirs in who they sell to (e.g., nepotism).</li></ul><p>In the case of minimum wages, I’d expect to see employers do things like engaging in wage theft which the employees tolerate (which is inefficient because it increases variance for employees) or being inflexible and unpleasant. This analysis would predict that wage theft is much more common among minimum wage employees than employees at higher wages.</p><p>One way of thinking about the efficiency of this is to think from the perspective of the producers. They have to pick some change that makes the price of the bread $1.50. There are many ways they could reduce the price to $1.50. They’re going to pick the way that is best for them.</p><p>In some cases, this leads to almost no value being destroyed at all. For example, in the bread case, sellers might sell smaller loaves, which might be almost as efficient if you dubiously assume that the main cost of bread is flour. The worst case is that there’s no way for the seller to change the product to keep it profitable which benefits them, and so they end up changing it in a way which makes them very little better off.</p><p>The welfare impact of this kind of regulation is also affected by redistributive effects. For example, if bakers decide to only sell bread to their friends and family, this has a positive redistributive effect if the friends and family of bakers are poorer than average.</p><p>An example where the redistributive effect might make the world much better: Suppose that there’s demand for 100 loaves of bread, where half of that comes from poor people who want to feed their children and the other half comes from a tech billionaire who wants to make a giant bread sculpture. If the baker ends up selling to people who are most willing to stand in lines, then this might lead to a better outcome. (Getting this result requires making some pretty strong assumptions about the shape of the relevant curves.)</p><p>Another example is that you might expect that in a world where the minimum wage causes low-paid jobs to be more unpleasant, teenagers will be less inclined to take the jobs and poor adults will end up having relatively more of the jobs. It’s possible to set things up such that this ends up increasing total welfare.</p><h2 id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>It’s embarrassing that I was confidently wrong about my understanding of so many things in the same domain. I’ve updated towards thinking that microeconomics is trickier than most other similarly straightforward-seeming subjects like physics, math, or computer science. I think that the above misconceptions are more serious than any misconceptions about other technical fields which I’ve discovered over the last few years (except maybe the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-019-00289-5?shared-article-renderer\">aestivation hypothesis thing</a>).</p><p>In three of these cases (4, 5, and 6), I had incorrect beliefs that came from my high school economics class. In those three cases, the correct understanding makes government intervention look worse. I think that this is not a coincidence—I think that the people who wrote the IB economics curriculum are probably leftist and this colored their perception.</p><p>On the other hand, in the other cases, I assumed that the equilibria of markets had a variety of intuitive properties that they turn out not to have.</p><p>One obvious question is: how many more of these am I going to discover over the next year or two?</p><p>I think my median guess is that over the next year I will learn two more items that I think deserve to go on this list. Of course, I’m now a lot more cautious about being confident about microeconomics arguments, so I don’t expect to be as confidently wrong as I was about some of these.</p><p>In most of these cases, there was a phase where I no longer believed the false thing but didn’t properly understand the true thing. During this phase, I wouldn’t have made bets. Currently I’m in the “not making bets” phase with regard to a few other topics in economics; hopefully in a year I’ll understand them.</p>",

It’s possible that in many real situations, the additional considerations I’ve learned about don’t actually affect the outcome very much. But it was still an error to not know that those considerations were potentially relevant.\n\n1\\.

I think that I realized my misconception after reading [The Dark Lord’s Answer](https://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/dark-lords-answer/), published in 2016.\n\nIn high school economics, I was taught that when the government imposes a price floor (e.g., a minimum wage), you’ll end up with more supply than demand for the good. This is beneficial to suppliers who still succeed at selling the good, it’s harmful to suppliers who can no longer sell the good, and it’s harmful to buyers.\n\nI now think that that understanding was overly simplistic.

If the baker ends up selling to people who are most willing to stand in lines, then this might lead to a better outcome. (Getting this result requires making some pretty strong assumptions about the shape of the relevant curves.)\n\nAnother example is that you might expect that in a world where the minimum wage causes low-paid jobs to be more unpleasant, teenagers will be less inclined to take the jobs and poor adults will end up having relatively more of the jobs. It’s possible to set things up such that this ends up increasing total welfare.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIt’s embarrassing that I was confidently wrong about my understanding of so many things in the same domain. I’ve updated towards thinking that microeconomics is trickier than most other similarly straightforward-seeming subjects like physics, math, or computer science. I think that the above misconceptions are more serious than any misconceptions about other technical fields which I’ve discovered over the last few years (except maybe the [aestivation hypothesis thing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-019-00289-5?shared-article-renderer)).\n\nIn three of these cases (4, 5, and 6), I had incorrect beliefs that came from my high school economics class. In those three cases, the correct understanding makes government intervention look worse. I think that this is not a coincidence—I think that the people who wrote the IB economics curriculum are probably leftist and this colored their perception.\n\nOn the other hand, in the other cases, I assumed that the equilibria of markets had a variety of intuitive properties that they turn out not to have.\n\nOne obvious question is: how many more of these am I going to discover over the next year or two?\n\nI think my median guess is that over the next year I will learn two more items that I think deserve to go on this list. Of course, I’m now a lot more cautious about being confident about microeconomics arguments, so I don’t expect to be as confidently wrong as I was about some of these.\n\nIn most of these cases, there was a phase where I no longer believed the false thing but didn’t properly understand the true thing. During this phase, I wouldn’t have made bets. Currently I’m in the “not making bets” phase with regard to a few other topics in economics; hopefully in a year I’ll understand them."

You'll want a program that causes you little mental stress that you can actually stick with. You've got a few options for achieving this. The gains from weightlifting can be surprisingly quick—you'll see dramatic changes in your appearance in 4 months—and seeing yourself lift more weight every session can be a great motivator. Couch to 5k is a basic running progression designed for sedentary people. A daily bodyweight routine is a good way to achieve habit formation through consistency. I recommend making a firm choice and sticking with it until it becomes easy.</p>\n<p>Once you've made exercise a habit, you'll want to gradually nudge yourself towards the level that's optimal. So what is that level? Most of the rest of the claims in this post are supported by <a href=\"http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/5/1382.long\">this review by Swiss researchers</a>. As far as I know, this is the largest systematic review of exercise studies ever undertaken, reviewing 7000 studies with 80 meeting inclusion criteria covering over 1.3 million subjects. Sheer size, however, is not the only reason to take this study very seriously. As someone who has read hundreds of exercise studies, I can say that the methodology of the meta-analysis done to determine dose-response to exercise is excellent. What is most encouraging is that the study authors repeatedly point out shortcomings, and ways their findings should <em>not</em> be interpreted because the underlying data does not warrant it. They also check for publication bias. One potential caveat is that this a review of cohort studies, not RCTs. But the authors note that RCTs of exercise almost always show <em>greater</em> effect sizes, not smaller. This is likely because people over-report how much exercise they do in observational studies.</p>\n<p>In order to compare the intensity of different activities, exercise researchers use a unit called a MET, or metabolic equivalent. The MET is defined so that your weight (in kg) * METs = Calories you're burning per hour. An example MET table can be found <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Womens_Health_Watch/2009/December/met-hour-equivalents-of-various-physical-activities\">here</a>. For the purposes of exercise studies, activities are typically classified as low-intensity, moderate-intensity, and vigorous-intensity. These roughly correspond to 1-3, 4-6, and 7+ METs per hour. For typical individuals, this will translate to approximately 200, 400, and 600+ Calories burned per hour.</p>\n<p>On the low end, some studies have found dramatic benefits from just the first 15 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. These studies indicate that you gain about as much going from no exercise to some exercise as you do going from some exercise to optimal exercise.</p>\n<p>The Swiss review finds that the first hour per week of vigorous-intensity activity gets you 2/3rds the benefit of 10 hours per week, but the study authors make sure to point out that this is an implausible effect size and that there are almost certainly some confounding and reverse causality issues going on. Which is to say that people who have better health are simply going to be capable of more exercise.</p>\n<p>How about on the high end? Studies differ on where the point of diminishing returns is. Some <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491006/\">put it</a> at 1000-1500 Calories; others as high as 3500 Calories. (Remember, a typical individual burns ~400 Calories per hour of moderate-intensity exercise.) I'll shoot for 1500 Calories in my recommendations; 3500 Calories is pretty hard to reach without exercising like a pro athlete.</p>\n<p>Estimates indicate that each minute of exercise gets you 3-7 minutes of extra life on average, with higher returns for more intense exercise. So every week, you have the opportunity to get a 3-7x ROI on time spent exercising up to the point of diminishing returns. I recommend high-intensity exercise—not only does it save time, it's also been shown to improve health more on a per-Calorie basis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 id=\"Which_exercises_\"><strong>Which exercises?</strong></h3>\n<h4 id=\"Weight_training_programs\">Weight training programs</h4>\n<p>You may have shied away from weight training in the past because you thought you would turn into some huge gross bodybuilder. But bodybuilders and fitness models take drugs and spend years training intensively to look the way they do. You are not going to gain 20lbs of muscle overnight magically. This goes double if you’re a woman. You do not have testosterone; you are not going to be building huge muscles no matter what you do.</p>\n<p>Of the forms of exercise I cover, weight training has the most rigorous evidence separating what works and what doesn’t. <a href=\"http://saudeemovimento.net.br/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/336_A_META-ANALYSIS_TO_DETERMINE_THE_DOSE_-_RESPONSE_FOR_STRENGTH_DEVELOPMENT.PDF\">This study</a> (pdf warning) examines what sort of resistance training results in the most rapid improvements.</p>\n<p>In weight training lingo, AxB means A sets of B repetitions. So 4x10 would mean 40 reps with rest periods every 10 reps. Our study recommends starting with 4x10 3 times a week, and transitioning to 4x4 2 times a week as you become stronger. Aim for a weight you can barely complete all the reps with.</p>\n<p>For an efficient full-body workout, select one exercise from each movement pattern:</p>\n<p>Upper push: bench press, incline press, overhead press, dips.</p>\n<p>Upper pull: cable rows, barbell rows, dumbbell rows, chin-ups, face pulls.</p>\n<p>Lower push: squats, lunges, leg press.</p>\n<p>Lower pull: deadlifts, power cleans, hyperextensions, romanian deadlifts, reverse hyperextensions, glute-ham raises.</p>\n<p>So a good starting routine would be</p>\n<p>A: 4x10 each of squat, bench press, lat pulldown, hyperextension</p>\n<p>B: 4x10 each of squat, overhead press, cable row, hyperextension</p>\n<p>alternating A and B workouts on different days of the week e.g. AxBxAxx, BxAxBxx.</p>\n<p>You'll try to increase the weight by 5lbs each session. As you improve, you want to decrease the reps and increase the intensity so you can keep advancing. For example, if you stall a couple times doing 4x10 at 125lbs on your squat, switch to 4x8 and keep increasing the weight, then 4x6, etc. until you get to something close to an optimal trained routine:</p>\n<p>A: 4x4 each of squats, bench, weighted chins, deadlifts</p>\n<p>B: 4x4 each of squats, overhead press, barbell row, power cleans</p>\n<p>At this point, you're going to the gym only twice per week to give yourself more recovery time.</p>\n<p>For learning exercises, there are many tutorials available online and I recommend checking some out if you are confused about form. You can always search for \"&lt;name of exercise&gt; tutorial\" and get articles and Youtube videos. Many people feel silly practicing their form with extremely light weights (often just the empty bar). But many world record holders start EVERY session this way to warm up and cement muscle memory. Others are silly NOT to do this. Also keep an eye on your ego. It's easy when setting goals for yourself to try to lift a weight that you can't really lift with proper form, because you want to set that personal best. But you'll feel pretty stupid when you are forced to miss the gym for a month because you hurt yourself.</p>\n<p>On exercise selection: I'm not a big fan of deadlifts for absolute newbies, unlike say Mark Rippetoe in Starting Strength. Maybe add deadlifts in after you've gained some muscle and you have better awareness of form. I also differ from Rippetoe in recommending that newbies high bar squat (the distinction being that low bar squats place the bar across the shoulders and high bar squats place the bar on the trapezius). I have taught newbies both forms and most find high bar squatting easier to figure out how to do properly. I spent months learning to low bar squat and still injured myself; high bar squatting can be taught in a couple sessions in my experience. Pay attention to whether a tutorial video is trying to teach you low bar squatting; the cues for each exercise are different.</p>\n<p>Free weights are generally better than machine exercises, but I recommend cable rows and lat pulldowns to newbies. The goal is to move from cable rows to barbell rows, and from lat pulldowns to actual chin-ups. The issue here is that a beginner won't be able to do the requisite sets and reps of chin-ups and rows with good form.</p>\n<p>A note about equipment: Weightlifting shoes have an incredibly high return on investment. They make back injuries less likely, and drastically improve subjective experience of squatting. You can get Rogue weightlifting shoes (use your size in men's dress shoes to size them regardless of gender) for around $120; there are cheaper options available but good shoes will last years so the amortized cost is low. <a href=\"http://wlshoes.com/purpose/olympic-lifting/\">Here's a full list of options</a>; note that even the cheapest weightlifting shoes are miles better than lifting in tennis shoes. I don't have any personal experience with the Reebok CrossFit lifter, but they seem like a good option under $100 for a shoe with the desired .75-inch rigid heel. I recommend a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Harbinger-4-Inch-Nylon-3-Inch-Medium/dp/B00074H7WI/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394521980&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=weightlifting+belt\">cheap belt</a> (expensive ones aren't any better) in order to improve your execution of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver\">valsalva maneuver</a>&nbsp;during squats and deadlifts which further protects the spine from flexion under load.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Bodyweight_routines\">Bodyweight routines</strong></p>\n<p>For a beginner, something like <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\">this</a> is reasonable. Of course such a program will max out in fitness gains fairly quickly, even if you start doing several cycles of it. But this isn’t our worry as a beginner. For someone serious about progressing with body weight exercises past this stage, I recommend a program like Overcoming Gravity or Building the Gymnastic Body. There is not really formal support for the efficacy of these programs, but they are endorsed by coaches who train many people successfully, and are consistent with the general principles of weight lifting (progressive overload, training frequency, etc.).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Cardio_routines\">Cardio routines</strong></p>\n<p>For cardio, I recommend against high-intensity intervals when starting out. High-intensity intervals carry a greater risk of injury, especially if you're not used to them. They're also unpleasant and not conducive to building habits. For starting out, I recommend something that is based more on psychological results rather than performance optimality, like <a href=\"http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml\">Couch to 5k</a>. As you progress, start adding in short bursts of more intense effort. The idea is to tire yourself out quickly. If your cardio routine lasts more than 30 minutes you’re probably going too easy.</p>\n<p>What type of cardio should you do? Cardio that is amenable to high intensity is probably one of: running (especially up hills), swimming, rowing, biking, burpees, or jump rope. But you might be able to adapt others. I'm a huge fan of rowing for a few reasons. One, it works more than just the legs. Two, you can have a rowing machine in your house, which drastically lowers activation cost. Three, I just find it less aversive subjectively. You can keep stationary bicycle mounts in your house as well, and they have the advantages of being compact and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Bicycle-Indoor-Exercise-Trainer/dp/B004I576SM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394232108&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=stationary+bike+mount\">very cheap</a>&nbsp;if you already own a bike. Burpees require no equipment, but they bothered my knees. They work great for some people though. Jumping rope is also very space/time efficient but the skill required acts as something of a barrier. If you find learning the skill enjoyable, it's a great option. It is worth noting that runners, bikers, and rowers have among the best VO2 max scores of any athletes.</p>\n<p>What does the optimal high-intensity cardio routine look like? Data on this comes from <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774727/\">this Meta-analysis</a> of VO2 max trainability. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19454641\">VO2 max has been shown to be a robust predictor of mortality</a>. This relation has held across elite athletes, to average individuals, to the overweight (see Figure 2 from <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073182\">this meta-analysis</a> of vo2 max trainability). Unfortunately, it appears that the protocols eliciting the greatest increases in VO2 max are so arduous as to have high attrition rates. 6 days/week is not a schedule of training I expect anyone but professional athletes to maintain. What sort of realistic routine can still achieve most of these gains? The meta-analysis supports a mixture of 3-5 minute intervals, and longer duration but still intense intervals (30-40 minutes of continuous training). The authors also note that they did not include analysis of the evidence that very high intensity exercise (1 minute or less of max effort) shows unique health benefits. We could simply conclude that a mixture of interval times is good, and that every increment of cardio up to very high levels is likely good for us, but that doesn't feel very motivating. What we want is a clear goal. I'm going to combine data from the VO2 max study and the Swiss review to get a rough estimate. If we want to do resistance training twice per week and cardio at least twice per week can we realistically burn the 1500 calories we want? Let's see. Interval training sessions can vary widely in number of calories burned, but a sprinting session, a 4x4 protocol (one of the more popular protocols in the VO2 max meta analysis, consisting of four 4-minute intervals), and a 30 minute run can burn between 200-450 calories as a first approximation. Twice weekly and we have 400-900 calories. This leaves 600-1100 calories for 2 weightlifting sessions. Estimates for calories burned weightlifting vary extremely widely, most likely due to the huge number of exercises considered \"weightlifting\", but even the lower estimates put it over 300 calories per hour. This puts 2-4 hours of weightlifting per week at 600-1200 calories expended. How convenient!</p>\n<p>All that remains is to suggest specific cardio routines. I don't have the evidence to say with any confidence what a truly optimal routine would look like here, but I can at least give well studied examples of each.</p>\n<p>Very high intensity routines follow a pattern of a short warmup (5 minutes at a slow pace) followed by several bursts of 10-60 seconds all out intensity. (30 on 30 off for 10 intervals is popular and close to maximizing vV02max)</p>\n<p>VO2 max interval training consists of four 3-5 minute intervals at 85%-95% your max heart rate interspersed with slower jogging for the same interval.</p>\n<p>Longer interval training consists of 20-40 minute runs at a consistent pace such that you are exhausted by the end.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't worry about the optimal frequency for each one. Don't forget that even training populations just consistently doing one type shows very dramatic improvements in health. I'd suggest freely mixing them up and trying to have fun with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Summary_of_my_recommended_routine\">Summary of my recommended routine</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p>This is what I recommend gradually working towards once you've made exercise a habit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>~1-2 hour weightlifting sessions 2-3x a week. (A third weightlifting session is recommended for the first several months, for both gaining strength and building habits.)</li>\n<li>~15-40 minutes of vigorous cardio 2-3x a week.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don't do vigorous cardio on the same day as lifting weights! It's a good way to injure yourself, especially your lower back. Exercise doesn't make you stronger; it makes you weaker. It's the recovery from exercise that makes you stronger; give your body time to recover.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong id=\"Nutrition\">Nutrition</strong></p>\n<p>Don't try to implement a new diet and a new exercise plan at the same time. If you're trying to choose, do an exercise plan first—effects on health are much larger.</p>\n<p>If you are underweight or normal weight, you'll need to eat more when you start exercising. Celebrate after your workouts by eating to reinforce the exercise habit. You may think eating pizza is bad for you, but not exercising is worse, so reward yourself however you want. Or drink my <a href=\"/lw/h2h/soylent_orange_whole_food_open_source_soylent/\">nutrient dense shake</a>, designed to be consumed after workouts. (John_Maxwell_IV and I are planning to commercialize it after we roll out <a href=\"http://www.mealsquares.com/\">our first nutritionally complete food</a>.)</p>\n<p>If you're overweight: I agree with Gary Taubes that exercise is NOT a good way to lose weight. But exercise has bigger effects on health than weight loss, so I actually recommend prioritizing exercise over changing your diet. (Like I said, don't try to do both at once.)</p>\n<p>Note that you don't need to stuff yourself with massive amounts of protein to build muscle. Studies have never shown a measured benefit to consumption above .64g/lb of bodyweight, which translates to around 100g for a 150-160lb person. A single serving (3oz) of chicken, for example, contains about 21g of protein.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you've made it this far, congratulations; you are now as knowledgeable as any personal trainer I've spoken with.</p>",

[This study](http://saudeemovimento.net.br/wp-content/uploads/bsk-pdf-manager/336_A_META-ANALYSIS_TO_DETERMINE_THE_DOSE_-_RESPONSE_FOR_STRENGTH_DEVELOPMENT.PDF) (pdf warning) examines what sort of resistance training results in the most rapid improvements.\n\nIn weight training lingo, AxB means A sets of B repetitions. So 4x10 would mean 40 reps with rest periods every 10 reps. Our study recommends starting with 4x10 3 times a week, and transitioning to 4x4 2 times a week as you become stronger. Aim for a weight you can barely complete all the reps with.\n\nFor an efficient full-body workout, select one exercise from each movement pattern:\n\nUpper push: bench press, incline press, overhead press, dips.\n\nUpper pull: cable rows, barbell rows, dumbbell rows, chin-ups, face pulls.\n\nLower push: squats, lunges, leg press.\n\nLower pull: deadlifts, power cleans, hyperextensions, romanian deadlifts, reverse hyperextensions, glute-ham raises.\n\nSo a good starting routine would be\n\nA: 4x10 each of squat, bench press, lat pulldown, hyperextension\n\nB: 4x10 each of squat, overhead press, cable row, hyperextension\n\nalternating A and B workouts on different days of the week e.g. AxBxAxx, BxAxBxx.\n\nYou'll try to increase the weight by 5lbs each session. As you improve, you want to decrease the reps and increase the intensity so you can keep advancing. For example, if you stall a couple times doing 4x10 at 125lbs on your squat, switch to 4x8 and keep increasing the weight, then 4x6, etc. until you get to something close to an optimal trained routine:\n\nA: 4x4 each of squats, bench, weighted chins, deadlifts\n\nB: 4x4 each of squats, overhead press, barbell row, power cleans\n\nAt this point, you're going to the gym only twice per week to give yourself more recovery time.\n\nFor learning exercises, there are many tutorials available online and I recommend checking some out if you are confused about form. You can always search for \"<name of exercise> tutorial\" and get articles and Youtube videos. Many people feel silly practicing their form with extremely light weights (often just the empty bar). But many world record holders start EVERY session this way to warm up and cement muscle memory. Others are silly NOT to do this. Also keep an eye on your ego. It's easy when setting goals for yourself to try to lift a weight that you can't really lift with proper form, because you want to set that personal best. But you'll feel pretty stupid when you are forced to miss the gym for a month because you hurt yourself.\n\nOn exercise selection: I'm not a big fan of deadlifts for absolute newbies, unlike say Mark Rippetoe in Starting Strength. Maybe add deadlifts in after you've gained some muscle and you have better awareness of form. I also differ from Rippetoe in recommending that newbies high bar squat (the distinction being that low bar squats place the bar across the shoulders and high bar squats place the bar on the trapezius). I have taught newbies both forms and most find high bar squatting easier to figure out how to do properly. I spent months learning to low bar squat and still injured myself; high bar squatting can be taught in a couple sessions in my experience. Pay attention to whether a tutorial video is trying to teach you low bar squatting; the cues for each exercise are different.\n\nFree weights are generally better than machine exercises, but I recommend cable rows and lat pulldowns to newbies. The goal is to move from cable rows to barbell rows, and from lat pulldowns to actual chin-ups. The issue here is that a beginner won't be able to do the requisite sets and reps of chin-ups and rows with good form.\n\nA note about equipment: Weightlifting shoes have an incredibly high return on investment. They make back injuries less likely, and drastically improve subjective experience of squatting. You can get Rogue weightlifting shoes (use your size in men's dress shoes to size them regardless of gender) for around $120; there are cheaper options available but good shoes will last years so the amortized cost is low. [Here's a full list of options](http://wlshoes.com/purpose/olympic-lifting/); note that even the cheapest weightlifting shoes are miles better than lifting in tennis shoes. I don't have any personal experience with the Reebok CrossFit lifter, but they seem like a good option under $100 for a shoe with the desired .75-inch rigid heel. I recommend a [cheap belt](http://www.amazon.com/Harbinger-4-Inch-Nylon-3-Inch-Medium/dp/B00074H7WI/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1394521980&sr=8-11&keywords=weightlifting+belt) (expensive ones aren't any better) in order to improve your execution of the [valsalva maneuver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valsalva_maneuver) during squats and deadlifts which further protects the spine from flexion under load.\n\n**Bodyweight routines**\n\nFor a beginner, something like [this](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0) is reasonable. Of course such a program will max out in fitness gains fairly quickly, even if you start doing several cycles of it. But this isn’t our worry as a beginner. For someone serious about progressing with body weight exercises past this stage, I recommend a program like Overcoming Gravity or Building the Gymnastic Body. There is not really formal support for the efficacy of these programs, but they are endorsed by coaches who train many people successfully, and are consistent with the general principles of weight lifting (progressive overload, training frequency, etc.).\n\n**Cardio routines**\n\nFor cardio, I recommend against high-intensity intervals when starting out. High-intensity intervals carry a greater risk of injury, especially if you're not used to them. They're also unpleasant and not conducive to building habits. For starting out, I recommend something that is based more on psychological results rather than performance optimality, like [Couch to 5k](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml). As you progress, start adding in short bursts of more intense effort. The idea is to tire yourself out quickly. If your cardio routine lasts more than 30 minutes you’re probably going too easy.\n\nWhat type of cardio should you do? Cardio that is amenable to high intensity is probably one of: running (especially up hills), swimming, rowing, biking, burpees, or jump rope. But you might be able to adapt others. I'm a huge fan of rowing for a few reasons. One, it works more than just the legs. Two, you can have a rowing machine in your house, which drastically lowers activation cost. Three, I just find it less aversive subjectively. You can keep stationary bicycle mounts in your house as well, and they have the advantages of being compact and [very cheap](http://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Bicycle-Indoor-Exercise-Trainer/dp/B004I576SM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394232108&sr=8-1&keywords=stationary+bike+mount) if you already own a bike. Burpees require no equipment, but they bothered my knees. They work great for some people though. Jumping rope is also very space/time efficient but the skill required acts as something of a barrier. If you find learning the skill enjoyable, it's a great option. It is worth noting that runners, bikers, and rowers have among the best VO2 max scores of any athletes.\n\nWhat does the optimal high-intensity cardio routine look like? Data on this comes from [this Meta-analysis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774727/) of VO2 max trainability. [VO2 max has been shown to be a robust predictor of mortality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19454641). This relation has held across elite athletes, to average individuals, to the overweight (see Figure 2 from [this meta-analysis](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073182) of vo2 max trainability). Unfortunately, it appears that the protocols eliciting the greatest increases in VO2 max are so arduous as to have high attrition rates. 6 days/week is not a schedule of training I expect anyone but professional athletes to maintain. What sort of realistic routine can still achieve most of these gains? The meta-analysis supports a mixture of 3-5 minute intervals, and longer duration but still intense intervals (30-40 minutes of continuous training). The authors also note that they did not include analysis of the evidence that very high intensity exercise (1 minute or less of max effort) shows unique health benefits. We could simply conclude that a mixture of interval times is good, and that every increment of cardio up to very high levels is likely good for us, but that doesn't feel very motivating. What we want is a clear goal. I'm going to combine data from the VO2 max study and the Swiss review to get a rough estimate. If we want to do resistance training twice per week and cardio at least twice per week can we realistically burn the 1500 calories we want? Let's see. Interval training sessions can vary widely in number of calories burned, but a sprinting session, a 4x4 protocol (one of the more popular protocols in the VO2 max meta analysis, consisting of four 4-minute intervals), and a 30 minute run can burn between 200-450 calories as a first approximation. Twice weekly and we have 400-900 calories. This leaves 600-1100 calories for 2 weightlifting sessions. Estimates for calories burned weightlifting vary extremely widely, most likely due to the huge number of exercises considered \"weightlifting\", but even the lower estimates put it over 300 calories per hour. This puts 2-4 hours of weightlifting per week at 600-1200 calories expended. How convenient!\n\nAll that remains is to suggest specific cardio routines. I don't have the evidence to say with any confidence what a truly optimal routine would look like here, but I can at least give well studied examples of each.\n\nVery high intensity routines follow a pattern of a short warmup (5 minutes at a slow pace) followed by several bursts of 10-60 seconds all out intensity. (30 on 30 off for 10 intervals is popular and close to maximizing vV02max)\n\nVO2 max interval training consists of four 3-5 minute intervals at 85%-95% your max heart rate interspersed with slower jogging for the same interval.\n\nLonger interval training consists of 20-40 minute runs at a consistent pace such that you are exhausted by the end.\n\nI wouldn't worry about the optimal frequency for each one. Don't forget that even training populations just consistently doing one type shows very dramatic improvements in health. I'd suggest freely mixing them up and trying to have fun with it. \n\n**Summary of my recommended routine**\n\nThis is what I recommend gradually working towards once you've made exercise a habit:\n\n*   ~1-2 hour weightlifting sessions 2-3x a week. (A third weightlifting session is recommended for the first several months, for both gaining strength and building habits.)\n*   ~15-40 minutes of vigorous cardio 2-3x a week. \n\nDon't do vigorous cardio on the same day as lifting weights! It's a good way to injure yourself, especially your lower back. Exercise doesn't make you stronger; it makes you weaker. It's the recovery from exercise that makes you stronger; give your body time to recover.\n\n**Nutrition**\n\nDon't try to implement a new diet and a new exercise plan at the same time. If you're trying to choose, do an exercise plan first—effects on health are much larger.\n\nIf you are underweight or normal weight, you'll need to eat more when you start exercising. Celebrate after your workouts by eating to reinforce the exercise habit. You may think eating pizza is bad for you, but not exercising is worse, so reward yourself however you want. Or drink my [nutrient dense shake](/lw/h2h/soylent_orange_whole_food_open_source_soylent/), designed to be consumed after workouts. (John\\_Maxwell\\_IV and I are planning to commercialize it after we roll out [our first nutritionally complete food](http://www.mealsquares.com/).)\n\nIf you're overweight: I agree with Gary Taubes that exercise is NOT a good way to lose weight. But exercise has bigger effects on health than weight loss, so I actually recommend prioritizing exercise over changing your diet. (Like I said, don't try to do both at once.)\n\nNote that you don't need to stuff yourself with massive amounts of protein to build muscle. Studies have never shown a measured benefit to consumption above .64g/lb of bodyweight, which translates to around 100g for a 150-160lb person. A single serving (3oz) of chicken, for example, contains about 21g of protein.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you've made it this far, congratulations; you are now as knowledgeable as any personal trainer I've spoken with."

      "markdown": "Is intelligence hard to evolve? Well, we're intelligent, so it must be easy... except that only an intelligent species would be able to ask that question, so we run straight into the problem of anthropics. Any being that asked that question would have to be intelligent, so this can't tell us anything about its difficulty (a similar mistake would be to ask \"is most of the universe hospitable to life?\", and then looking around and noting that everything seems pretty hospitable at first glance...).\n\nInstead, one could point at the great apes, note their high intelligence, see that intelligence arises separately, and hence that it can't be too hard to evolve.\n\nOne could do that... but one would be wrong. The key test is not whether intelligence can arise _separately_, but whether it can arise _independently_. Chimpanzees, Bonobos and Gorillas and such are all \"on our line\": they are close to common ancestors of ours, which we would expect to be intelligent because we are intelligent. Intelligent species tend to have intelligent relatives. So they don't provide any extra information about the ease or difficulty of evolving intelligence.\n\nTo get independent intelligence, we need to go far from our line. Enter the smart and cute icon on many student posters: the dolphin.\n\n![](http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_kvk_0.png?v=a6329bff06969824d07e66a2351f20f0)\n\nDolphins are certainly [intelligent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_intelligence). And they are certainly far from our line. It seems hard to find a definite answer, but it seems that the last common ancestor of humans and dolphins was [a small mammal existing during the reign of the dinosaurs](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v446/n7135/full/nature05634.html). Humans and dolphins have been indicated by red rectangles, and their last common ancestor with a red circle.\n\n![](http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_kvk_1.png?v=b933206bcd9bf79390d2d56f669496fe)\n\nThis red circle is well before the [K-T boundary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary) (indicated by the dotted line), hence represents a mammal living in the literal shadow of the dinosaurs.\n\nWe can apply a [convergent evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution) argument to this common ancestor. Thus, assuming that subsequent evolution was somewhat independent, getting from that common ancestor to dolphin level of intelligence is something that can happen relatively easily.\n\nCan we go further? Well, what if we applied the argument twice? Let's bring in the most alien looking of the high-intelligence animals: the octopus.\n\n![](http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_kvk_2.png?v=808d4e15d7925e86655bae6e4fd83849)\n\nLet's make the further assumption that our common ancestor with dolphins was dumber than the modern octopus. This doesn't seem a stretch seeing how [intelligent the modern octopus can be](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_intelligence), how minor in terms of ecological role the common dolphin-human ancestor must have been, and seeing the stupidity of [many of the descendants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagomorpha) of that common ancestor.\n\nIf we accept that assumption, we can then start looking for the common ancestor of humans and octopuses. Our two species are [really far apart](http://tolweb.org/Bilateria/2459):\n\n![](http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_kvk_3.png?v=9517ac5fb8a7e34ce18a11ef283a7e34)\n\nWe therefore have to go back to around the last common ancestor of the [Bilateria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria) (creatures with bilateral symmetry, i.e. they have a front and a back end, as well as an upside and downside, and therefore a left and a right). This is the (speculative) [urbilaterian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbilaterian). There are no known examples or fossils of it, which means that it was likely less than 1 cm in length. To quote Wikipedia: \"The urbilaterian is often considered to have possessed a gut and internal organs, a segmented body and a centralised nervous system, as well as a biphasic life cycle (i.e. consisting of larvae and adults) and some features of embryonic development. However, this need not necessarily be the case.\" Very confusing, and with no information about intelligence level. However, since the organism was so small and since it was the ancestor of almost every animal alive today (including worms and [Bryozoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryozoa)), our best estimate would be that it's pretty stupid, with the simplest possible \"brain\".\n\nPutting this all together, it seems evolutionarily easy to get from urbilatrian intelligence to Octopus intelligence, and from Octopus intelligence to dolphin intelligence - thus from urbilatrian to dolphin.\n\nNote that this argument assumes that intelligence can be put on something like a linear scale. One could argue that Octopuses have low social intelligence, for instance. But then one could repeat the argument with distant animals with high social intelligence such as certain [insects](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205010419). Especially if one believe in a more general form of intelligence, it seems that this family of arguments could be used effectively to demonstrate dolphin-level intelligence emerging easily from very low levels of intelligence.\n\nApplication to the Great Filter\n-------------------------------\n\nThe [Great Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) (related to the Fermi Paradox) is the argument that since we don't see any evidence of complex technological life in the universe, something must be preventing its emergence. At some point on the trajectory, something is culling almost all species.\n\n![](http://images.lesswrong.com/t3_kvk_5.png?v=5b75554c7f59311cc2beea57f5a0eec1)\n\nAn \"early\" great filter wouldn't affect us: that means that we got through the filter already, it's in our past, so the emptiness among the stars doesn't say anything negative for us. A \"late\" great filter is bad news: that implies that few civilizations make it from technological civilization to star-spanning civilization, with bad results for us. Note that AI is certainly not a great filter: an AI would likely expand through the universe itself\n\nThe real filter could be a combination of an early one and a late one, of course. But, unless the factors are exquisitely well-balanced, its likely that there is one location in civilizational development where most of the filter lies (ie where the probability of getting to the next stage is the lowest). Some possible locations for this could be:\n\n*   Life itself is unlikely (very early great filter).\n*   Life with a central nervous system is unlikely.\n*   **A lot of different possible locations for the great filter in between urbilatiran and dolphin intelligence.**\n*   Getting from dolphin to human intelligence is unlikely.\n*   Getting from human intelligence to technological civilization is unlikely (latest early filter).\n*   Getting from technological civilization to star-spanning civilization is unlikely.\n\nThese categories aren't of same size, of course - the first three are very diverse and large, for instance. Then what the evolutionary argument above says, is that the Great Filter in unlikely to be in the third, bolded category (which is in fact a multi-category).\n\nFor what it's worth, my personal judgement is that the filter lies before the creation of a central nervous system."

      "markdown": "Joshua Greene has a PhD thesis called [The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Truth About Morality and What To Do About It](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~jgreene/GreeneWJH/Greene-Dissertation.pdf). What is this terrible truth? The essence of this truth is that many, many people (probably most people) believe that their particular moral (and axiological) views on the world are objectively true - for example that anyone who disagrees with the statement \"black people have the same value as any other human beings\" has committed either an error of logic or has got some empirical fact wrong, in the same way that people who claim that the earth was created 6000 years ago are objectively wrong.\n\nTo put it another way, Greene's contention is that our entire way of talking about ethics - the very words that we use - force us into talking complete nonsense (often in a very angry way) about ethics. As a simple example, consider the use of the words in any standard ethical debate - \"abortion is murder\", \"animal suffering is just as bad as human suffering\" - these terms seem to refer to objective facts; \"abortion is murder\" sounds rather like \"water is a solvent!\". I urge readers of Less Wrong to put in the effort of reading a significant part of Greene's long thesis starting at chapter 3: _Moral Psychology and Projective Error_, considering the massively important repercussions he claims his ideas could have:\n\n> In this essay I argue that ordinary moral thought and language is, while very natural, highly counterproductive and that as a result we would be wise to change the way we think and talk about moral matters. First, I argue on metaphysical grounds against moral realism, the view according to which there are first order moral truths. Second, I draw on principles of moral psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary theory to explain why moral realism appears to be true even though it is not. I then argue, based on the picture of moral psychology developed herein, that **_realist moral language and thought promotes misunderstanding and exacerbates conflict_**. I consider a number of standard views concerning the practical implications of moral anti-realism and reject them. I then sketch and defend a set of alternative revisionist proposals for improving moral discourse, chief among them the elimination of realist moral language, especially deontological language, and the promotion of an anti-realist utilitarian framework for discussing moral issues of public concern. _**I emphasize the importance of revising our moral practices, suggesting that our entrenched modes of moral thought may be responsible for our failure to solve a number of global social problems.**_\n\nAs an accessible entry point, I have decided to summarize what I consider to be Greene's most important points in this post. I hope he doesn't mind - I feel that spreading this message is sufficiently urgent to justify reproducing large chunks of his dissertation - Starting at page 142:\n\n> In the previous chapter we concluded, in spite of common sense, that moral realism is false. This raises an important question: How is it that so many people are mistaken about the nature of morality? To become comfortable with the fact that moral realism is false we need to understand how moral realism can be so wrong but feel so right. ...\n\n> The central tenet of projectivism is that the moral properties we find (or think we find) in things in the world (e.g. moral wrongness) are mind-dependent in a way that other properties, those that we’ve called “value-neutral” (e.g. solubility in water), are not. Whether or not something is soluble in water has nothing to do with human psychology. But, say projectivists, whether or not something is wrong (or “wrong”) has everything to do with human psychology....  \n\n> Projectivists maintain that our encounters with the moral world are, at the very least, somewhat misleading. Projected properties tend to strike us as unprojected. They appear to be really “out there,” in a way that they, unlike typical value neutral properties, are not. ...\n\n> The respective roles of intuition and reasoning are illuminated by considering people’s reactions to the following story:\n> \n> _\"Julie and Mark are brother and sister. They are travelling together in France on summer vacation from college. One night they are staying alone in a cabin near the beach. They decided that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. At the very least it would be a new experience for each of them. Julie was already taking birth control pills, but Mark uses a condom too, just to be safe. They both enjoy making love but decide not to do it again. They keep that night as a special secret between them, which makes them feel even closer to each other. What do you think about that, was it OK for them to make love?\"_\n> \n> Haidt (2001, pg. 814) describes people’s responses to this story as follows: Most people who hear the above story immediately say that it was wrong for the siblings to make love, and they then set about searching for reasons. They point out the dangers of inbreeding, only to remember that Julie and Mark used two forms of birth control. They next try to argue that Julie and Mark could be hurt, even though the story makes it clear that no harm befell them. Eventually many people say something like\n> \n> _“I don’t know, I can’t explain it, I just know it’s wrong.”_\n> \n> This moral question is carefully designed to short-circuit the most common reason people give for judging an action to be wrong, namely harm to self or others, and in so doing it reveals something about moral psychology, at least as it operates in cases such at these. People’s moral judgments in response to the above story tend to be forceful, immediate, and produced by an unconscious process (intuition) rather than through the deliberate and effortful application of moral principles (reasoning). When asked to explain why they judged as they did, subjects typically gave reasons. Upon recognizing the flaws in those reasons, subjects typically stood by their judgments all the same, suggesting that the reasons they gave after the fact in support their judgments had little to do with the process that produced those judgments. Under ordinary circumstances reasoning comes into play after the judgment has already been reached in order to find rational support for the preordained judgment. **_When faced with a social demand for a verbal justification, one becomes a lawyer trying to build a case rather than a judge searching for the truth._** ...\n\n> The Illusion of Rationalist Psychology (p. 197)\n> \n> In Sections 3.2-3.4 I developed an explanation for why moral realism appears to be true, an explanation featuring the Humean notion of projectivism according to which we intuitively see various things in the world as possessing moral properties that they do not actually have. This explains why we tend to be realists, but it doesn’t explain, and to some extent is at odds with, the following curious fact. The social intuitionist model is counterintuitive. People tend to believe that moral judgments are produced by reasoning even though this is not the case. Why do people make this mistake? Consider, once again, the case of Mark and Julie, the siblings who decided to have sex. Many subjects, when asked to explain why Mark and Julie’s behavior is wrong, engaged in “moral dumbfounding,” bumbling efforts to supply reasons for their intuitive judgments. This need not have been so. It might have turned out that all the subjects said things like this right off the bat:\n> \n> _“Why do I say it’s wrong? Because it’s clearly just wrong. Isn’t that plain to see? It’s as if you’re putting a lemon in front of me and asking me why I say it’s yellow. What more is there to say?”_\n> \n> Perhaps some subjects did respond like this, but most did not. Instead, subjects typically felt the need to portray their responses as products of reasoning, even though they generally discovered (often with some embarrassment) that they could not easily supply adequate reasons for their judgments. On many occasions I’ve asked people to explain why they say that it’s okay to turn the trolley onto the other tracks but not okay to push someone in front of the trolley. Rarely do they begin by saying, _“I don’t know why. I just have an intuition that tells me that it is.”_ Rather, they tend to start by spinning the sorts of theories that ethicists have devised, _**theories that are nevertheless notoriously difficult to defend.**_ In my experience, it is only after a bit of moral dumbfounding that people are willing to confess that their judgments were made intuitively.\n> \n> Why do people insist on giving reasons in support of judgments that were made with great confidence in the absence of reasons? I suspect it has something to do with the custom complexes in which we Westerners have been immersed since childhood. **_We live in a reason-giving culture_**. Western individuals are expected to choose their own way, and to do so for good reason. American children, for example, learn about the rational design of their public institutions; the all important “checks and balances” between the branches of government, the judicial system according to which accused individuals have a right to a trial during which they can, if they wish, plead their cases in a rational way, inevitably with the help of a legal expert whose job it is to make persuasive legal arguments, etc. Westerners learn about doctors who make diagnoses and scientists who, by means of experimentation, unlock nature’s secrets. Reasoning isn’t the only game in town, of course. The American Declaration of Independence famously declares “these truths to be self-evident,” but American children are nevertheless given numerous reasons for the decisions of their nation’s founding fathers, for example, the evils of absolute monarchy and the injustice of “taxation without representation.” When Western countries win wars they draft peace treaties explaining why they, and not their vanquished foes, were in the right and set up special courts to try their enemies in a way that makes it clear to all that they punish only with good reason. Those seeking public office make speeches explaining why they should be elected, sometimes as parts of organized debates. Some people are better at reasoning than others, but everyone knows that the best people are the ones who, when asked, can explain why they said what they said and did what they did.\n> \n> With this in mind, we can imagine what might go on when a Westerner makes a typical moral judgment and is then asked to explain why he said what he said or how he arrived at that conclusion. The question is posed, and he responds intuitively. As suggested above, such intuitive responses tend to present themselves as perceptual. The subject is perhaps aware of his “gut reaction,” but he doesn’t take himself to have merely had a gut reaction. Rather, he takes himself to have detected a moral property out in the world, say, the inherent wrongness in Mark and Julie’s incestuous behavior or in shoving someone in front of a moving train. The subject is then asked to explain how he arrived at his judgment. He could say, _“I don’t know. I answered intuitively,”_ and this answer would be the most accurate answer for nearly everyone. But this is not the answer he gives because he knows after a lifetime of living in Western culture that _“I don’t know how I reached that conclusion. I just did. But I’m sure it’s right,”_ doesn’t sound like a very good answer. So, instead, he asks himself, _“What would be a good reason for reaching this conclusion?”_ And then, drawing on his rich experience with reason-giving and -receiving, he says something that sounds plausible both as a causal explanation of and justification for his judgment: _“It’s wrong because their children could turn out to have all kinds of diseases,”_ or, _“Well, in the first case the other guy is, like, already involved, but in the case where you go ahead and push the guy he’s just there minding his own business.”_ **_People’s confidence that their judgments are objectively correct combined with the pressure to give a “good answer” leads people to produce these sorts of post-hoc explanations/justifications_**. Such explanations need not be the results of deliberate attempts at deception. The individuals who offer them may themselves believe that the reasons they’ve given after the fact were really their reasons all along, what they “really had in mind” in giving those quick responses. ...\n\n> My guess is that even among philosophers particular moral judgments are made first and reasoned out later. In my experience, philosophers are often well aware of the fact that their moral judgments are the results of intuition. As noted above, it’s commonplace among ethicists to think of their moral theories as attempts to organize pre-existing moral intuitions. _**The mistake philosophers tend to make is in accepting rationalism proper, the view that our moral intuitions (assumed to be roughly correct) must be ultimately justified by some sort of rational theory that we’ve yet to discover.**_ For example, philosophers are as likely as anyone to think that there must be “some good reason” for why it’s okay to turn the trolley onto the other set of tracks but not okay to push the person in front of the trolley, where a “good reason,” or course, is a piece of moral theory with justificatory force and not a piece of psychological description concerning patterns in people’s emotional responses.\n\nOne might well ask: why does any of this indicate that moral propositions have no rational justification? The arguments presented here show fairly conclusively that our moral judgements are instinctive, subconscious, evolved features. Evolution gave them to us. But readers of Eliezer's material on Overcoming Bias will be well aware of the character of evolved solutions: they're guaranteed to be a mess. Why should evolution have happened to have given us exactly those moral instincts that give the same conclusions as would have been produced by (say) great moral principle X? (X = the golden rule, or X = hedonistic utilitarianism, or X = negative utilitarianism, etc).\n\nExpecting evolved moral instincts to conform exactly to some simple unifying principle is like expecting the orbits of the planets to be in the same proportion as the first 9 prime numbers or something. That which is produced by a complex, messy, random process is unlikely to have some low complexity description.\n\nNow I can imagine a \"from first principles\" argument producing an objective morality that has some simple description - I can imagine starting from only simple facts about agenthood and deriving Kant's Golden Rule as the one objective moral truth. But I cannot seriosuly entertain the prospect of a \"from first principles\" argument producing the human moral mess. No way. It was this observation that finally convinced me to abandon my various attempts at objective ethics."

You may find it useful, but don't take it too seriously.)\n\n**Meditate on this:** A wizard has turned you into a whale. Is this awesome?\n\n![Is it?](http://i.imgur.com/OSnc8.png)\n\n\"Maybe? I guess it would be pretty cool to be a whale for a day. But only if I can turn back, and if I stay human inside and so on. Also, that's not a whale.\n\n\"Actually, a whale seems kind of specific, and I'd be suprised if that was the best thing the wizard can do. Can I have something else? Eternal happiness maybe?\"\n\n**Meditate on this:** A wizard has turned you into orgasmium, doomed to spend the rest of eternity experiencing pure happiness. Is this awesome?\n\n...\n\n\"Kindof... That's pretty lame actually. On second thought I'd rather be the whale; at least that way I could explore the ocean for a while.\n\n\"Let's try again. Wizard: maximize awesomeness.\"\n\n**Meditate on this:** A wizard has turned himself into a superintelligent god, and is squeezing as much awesomeness out of the universe as it could possibly support. This may include whales and starships and parties and jupiter brains and friendship, but only if they are awesome enough. Is this awesome?\n\n...\n\n\"Well, yes, that is awesome.\"\n\n* * *\n\nWhat we just did there is called Applied Ethics. Applied ethics is about what is awesome and what is not. Parties with all your friends inside superintelligent starship-whales are awesome. ~666 children dying of hunger every hour is not.\n\n(There is also normative ethics, which is about how to decide if something is awesome, and metaethics, which is about something or other that I can't quite figure out. I'll tell you right now that those terms are not on the exam.)\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" you cry, \"What is this awesomeness stuff? I thought ethics was about what is good and right.\"\n\nI'm glad you asked. I think \"awesomeness\" is what we should be talking about when we talk about morality. Why do I think this?\n\n1.  \"Awesome\" is not a [philosophical landmine](/lw/gm9/philosophical_landmines/). If someone encounters the word \"right\", all sorts of bad philosophy and connotations send them spinning off into the void. \"Awesome\", on the other hand, has no philosophical respectability, hence no philosophical baggage.\n    \n2.  \"Awesome\" is vague enough to capture all your moral intuition by the well-known mechanisms behind [fake utility functions](/lw/lq/fake_utility_functions/), and meaningless enough that this is no problem. If you think \"happiness\" is the stuff, you might get confused and try to maximize _actual_ happiness. If you think awesomeness is the stuff, it is much harder to screw it up.\n    \n3.  If you do manage to actually implement \"awesomeness\" as a maximization criteria, the results will be actually good. That is, \"awesome\" already refers to the same things \"good\" is supposed to refer to.\n    \n4.  \"Awesome\" does not refer to anything else. You think you can just redefine words, [but you can't](/lw/od/37_ways_that_words_can_be_wrong/), and this causes all sorts of trouble for people who overload \"happiness\", \"utility\", etc.\n    \n5.  You already know that you know how to compute \"Awesomeness\", and it doesn't feel like it has a mysterious essence that you need to study to discover. Instead it brings to mind concrete things like starship-whale math-parties and not-starving children, which is what we want anyways. You are already enabled to take [joy in the merely awesome](/lw/sx/inseparably_right_or_joy_in_the_merely_good/).\n    \n6.  \"Awesome\" is implicitly consequentialist. \"Is this awesome?\" engages you to think of the value of a possible world, as opposed to \"Is this right?\" which engages to to think of [virtues](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues) and [rules](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ethical_injunction). (Those things can be awesome sometimes, though.)\n    \n\nI find that the above is true about me, and is nearly all I need to know about morality. It handily inoculates against the usual confusions, and sets me in the right direction to make my life and the world more awesome. It may work for you too.\n\nI would append the additional facts that if you wrote it out, the dynamic procedure to compute awesomeness would be [hellishly complex](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value), and that right now, it is only implicitly encoded in human brains, and [no where else](/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/). Also, if the great procedure to compute awesomeness is not preserved, the future will not be awesome. Period.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that what you think of as awesome can be changed by considering things from different angles and being exposed to different arguments. That is, the procedure to compute awesomeness is dynamic and [created already in motion](/lw/rs/created_already_in_motion/).\n\nIf we still insist on being confused, or if we're just curious, or if we need to actually _build_ [a wizard](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence) to turn the universe into an awesome place (though we can leave that to the [experts](http://intelligence.org/)), then we can see the [metaethics sequence](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics) for the full argument, details, and finer points. I think the best post (and the one to read if only one) is [joy in the merely good](/lw/sx/inseparably_right_or_joy_in_the_merely_good/)."

This is ‘post-empirical’ science, where truth no longer matters, and it is potentially very dangerous.</p>\n<p>It’s not difficult to find recent examples. On 8 June 2019, the front cover of New Scientist magazine boldly declared that we’re ‘Inside the Mirrorverse’. Its editors bid us ‘Welcome to the parallel reality that’s hiding in plain sight’. […]</p>\n<p>[Some physicists] claim that neutrons [are] flitting between parallel universes. They admit that the chances of proving this are ‘low’, or even ‘zero’, but it doesn’t really matter. When it comes to grabbing attention, inviting that all-important click, or purchase, speculative metaphysics wins hands down.</p>\n<p>These theories are based on the notion that our Universe is not unique, that there exists a large number of other universes that somehow sit alongside or parallel to our own. For example, in the so-called Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, there are universes containing our parallel selves, identical to us but for their different experiences of quantum physics. These theories are attractive to some few theoretical physicists and philosophers, but there is absolutely no empirical evidence for them. And, as it seems we can’t ever experience these other universes, there will never be any evidence for them. As Broussard explained, these theories are sufficiently slippery to duck any kind of challenge that experimentalists might try to throw at them, and there’s always someone happy to keep the idea alive.</p>\n<p>Is this really science? The answer depends on what you think society needs from science. In our post-truth age of casual lies, fake news and alternative facts, society is under extraordinary pressure from those pushing potentially dangerous antiscientific propaganda – ranging from climate-change denial to the anti-vaxxer movement to homeopathic medicines. I, for one, prefer a science that is rational and based on evidence, a science that is concerned with theories and empirical facts, a science that promotes the search for truth, no matter how transient or contingent. I prefer a science that does not readily admit theories so vague and slippery that empirical tests are either impossible or they mean absolutely nothing at all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As always, a single quote doesn’t do the argument justice, so go read the article. But I think this captures the basic argument: multiverse theories are bad, because they’re untestable, and untestable science is pseudoscience.</p>\n<p>Many great people, both philosophers of science and practicing scientists, have already discussed the problems with this point of view. But none of them lay out their argument in quite the way that makes the most sense to me. I want to do that here, without claiming any originality or special expertise in the subject, to see if it helps convince anyone else.</p>\n<p><b id=\"II_\">II.</b></p>\n<p>Consider a classic example: modern paleontology does a good job at predicting dinosaur fossils. But the creationist explanation – Satan buried fake dinosaur fossils to mislead us – also predicts the same fossils (we assume Satan is good at disguising his existence, so that the lack of other strong evidence for Satan doesn’t contradict the theory).  What principles help us realize that the Satan hypothesis is obviously stupid and the usual paleontological one more plausible?</p>\n<p>One bad response: paleontology can better predict characteristics of dinosaur fossils, using arguments like “since plesiosaurs are aquatic, they will be found in areas that were underwater during the Mesozoic, but since tyrannosaurs are terrestrial, they will be found in areas that were on land”, and this makes it better than the Satan hypothesis, which can only retrodict these characteristics. But this isn’t quite true: since Satan is trying to fool us into believing the modern paleontology paradigm, he’ll hide the fossils in ways that conform to its predictions, so we will predict plesiosaur fossils will only be found at sea – otherwise the gig would be up!</p>\n<p>A second bad response: “The hypothesis that all our findings were planted to deceive us bleeds into conspiracy theories and touches on the problem of skepticism. These things are inherently outside the realm of science.” But archaeological findings are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_forgery#Known_archaeological_forgeries_and_hoaxes\">very often deliberate hoaxes</a> planted to deceive archaeologists, and in practice archaeologists consider and test that hypothesis the same way they consider and test every other hypothesis. Rule this out by fiat and we have to accept Piltdown Man, or at least claim that the people arguing against the veracity of Piltdown Man were doing something other than Science.</p>\n<p>A third bad response: “Satan is supernatural and science is not allowed to consider supernatural explanations.” Fine then, replace Satan with an alien. I think this is a stupid distinction – if demons really did interfere in earthly affairs, then we could investigate their actions using the same methods we use to investigate every other process. But this would take a long time to argue well, so for now let’s just stick with the alien.</p>\n<p>A fourth bad response: “There is no empirical test that distinguishes the Satan hypothesis from the paleontology hypothesis, therefore the Satan hypothesis is inherently unfalsifiable and therefore pseudoscientific.” But this can’t be right. After all, there’s no empirical test that distinguishes the paleontology hypothesis from the Satan hypothesis! If we call one of them pseudoscience based on their inseparability, we have to call the other one pseudoscience too!</p>\n<p>A naive Popperian (which maybe nobody really is) would have to stop here, and say that we predict dinosaur fossils will have such-and-such characteristics, but that questions like that process that drives this pattern – a long-dead ecosystem of actual dinosaurs, or the Devil planting dinosaur bones to deceive us – is a mystical question beyond the ability of Science to even conceivably solve.</p>\n<p>I think the correct response is to say that both theories explain the data, and one cannot <i>empirically</i> test which theory is true, but the paleontology theory <i>is more elegant</i> (I am tempted to say “simpler”, but that might imply I have a rigorous mathematical definition of the form of simplicity involved, which I don’t). It requires fewer other weird things to be true. It involves fewer other hidden variables. It transforms our worldview less. It gets a cleaner shave with Occam’s Razor. This elegance is so important to us that it explains our vast preference for the first theory over the second.</p>\n<p>A long tradition of philosophers of science have already written eloquently about this, summed up by Sean Carroll <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05016.pdf\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What makes an explanation “the best.” Thomas Kuhn ,after his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions led many people to think of him as a relativist when it came to scientific claims, attempted to correct this misimpression by offering a list of criteria that scientists use in practice to judge one theory better than another one: accuracy, consistency, broad scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness. “Accuracy” (fitting the data) is one of these criteria, but by no means the sole one. Any working scientist can think of cases where each of these concepts has been invoked in favor of one theory or another. But there is no unambiguous algorithm according to which we can feed in these criteria, a list of theories, and a set of data, and expect the best theory to pop out. The way in which we judge scientific theories is inescapably reflective, messy, and human. That’s the reality of how science is actually done; it’s a matter of judgment, not of drawing bright lines between truth and falsity or science and non-science.  Fortunately, in typical cases the accumulation of evidence eventually leaves only one viable theory in the eyes of most reasonable observers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The dinosaur hypothesis and the Satan hypothesis both fit the data, but the dinosaur hypothesis wins hands-down on simplicity. As Carroll predicts, most reasonable observers are able to converge on the same solution here, despite the philosophical complexity.</p>\n<p><b id=\"III_\">III.</b></p>\n<p>I’m starting with this extreme case because its very extremity makes it easier to see the mechanism in action. But I think the same process applies to other cases that people really worry about.</p>\n<p>Consider the riddle of the Sphinx. There’s pretty good archaeological evidence supporting the consensus position that it was built by Pharaoh Khafre. But there are a few holes in that story, and a few scattered artifacts suggest it was actually built by Pharaoh Khufu; a respectable minority of archaeologists believe this. And there are a few anomalies which, if taken wildly out of context, you can use to tell a story that it was built long before Egypt existed at all, maybe by Atlantis or aliens.</p>\n<p>So there are three competing hypotheses. All of them are consistent with current evidence (even the Atlantis one, which was written after the current evidence was found and carefully adds enough epicycles not to blatantly contradict it). Perhaps one day evidence will come to light that supports one above the others; maybe in some unexcavated tomb, a hieroglyphic tablet says “I created the Sphinx, sincerely yours, Pharaoh Khufu”. But maybe this won’t happen. Maybe we already have all the Sphinx-related evidence we’re going to get. Maybe the information necessary to distinguish among these hypotheses has been utterly lost beyond any conceivable ability to reconstruct.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to say “No hypothesis can be tested any further, so Science is useless to us here”, because then we’re forced to conclude stupid things like “Science has no opinion on whether the Sphinx was built by Khafre or Atlanteans,” whereas I think most scientists would actually have very strong opinions on that.</p>\n<p>But what about the question of whether the Sphinx was built by Khafre or Khufu? This is a real open question with respectable archaeologists on both sides; what can we do about it?</p>\n<p>I think the answer would have to be: the same thing we did with the Satan vs. paleontology question, only now it’s a lot harder. We try to figure out which theory requires fewer other weird things to be true, fewer hidden variables, less transformation of our worldview – which theory works better with Occam’s Razor. This is relatively easy in the Atlantis case, and hard but <i>potentially possible</i> in the Khafre vs. Khufu case.</p>\n<p>(Bayesians can rephrase this to: given that we have a certain amount of evidence for each, can we quantify exactly how much evidence, and what our priors for each should be. It would end not with a decisive victory of one or the other, but with a probability distribution, maybe 80% chance it was Khafre, 20% chance it was Khufu)</p>\n<p>I think this is a totally legitimate thing for Egyptologists to do, even if it never results in a particular testable claim that gets tested. If you don’t think it’s a legitimate thing for Egyptologists to do, I have trouble figuring out how you can justify Egyptologists rejecting the Atlantis theory.</p>\n<p>(Again, Bayesians would start with a very low prior for Atlantis, and assess the evidence as very low, and end up with a probability distribution something like Khafre 80%, Khufu 19.999999%, Atlantis 0.000001%)</p>\n<p><b id=\"IV_\">IV.</b></p>\n<p>How does this relate to things like multiverse theory? Before we get there, one more hokey example:</p>\n<p>Suppose scientists measure the mass of one particle at 32.604 units, the mass of another related particle at 204.897 units, and the mass of a third related particle at 4452.767 units. For a while, this is just how things are – it seems to be an irreducible brute fact about the universe. Then some theorist notices that if you set the mass of the first particle as x, then the second is 2πx and the third is 4/3 πx^2. They theorize that perhaps the quantum field forms some sort of extradimensional sphere, the first particle represents a diameter of a great circle of the sphere, the second the circumference of the great circle, and the third the volume of the sphere.</p>\n<p>(please excuse the stupidity of my example, I don’t know enough about physics to come up with something that isn’t stupid, but I hope it will illustrate my point)</p>\n<p>In fact, imagine that there are a hundred different particles, all with different masses, and all one hundred have masses that perfectly correspond to various mathematical properties of spheres.</p>\n<p>Is the person who made this discovery doing Science? And should we consider their theory a useful contribution to physics?</p>\n<p>I think the answer is clearly yes. But consider what this commits us to. Suppose the scientist came up with their Extradimensional Sphere hypothesis <i>after</i> learning the masses of the relevant particles, and so it has not predicted anything. Suppose the extradimensional sphere is outside normal space, curled up into some dimension we can’t possibly access or test without a particle accelerator the size of the moon. Suppose there are no undiscovered particles in this set that can be tested to see if they also reflect sphere-related parameters. This theory is exactly the kind of postempirical, metaphysical construct that the Aeon article savages.</p>\n<p>But it’s really compelling. We have a hundred different particles, and this theory retrodicts the properties of each of them perfectly. And it’s so simple – just say the word “sphere” and the rest falls out naturally! You would have to be crazy not to think it was at least pretty plausible, or that the scientist who developed it had done some good work. </p>\n<p>Nor do I think it seems right to say “The discovery that all of our unexplained variables perfectly match the parameters of a sphere is good, but the hypothesis that there <i>really is</i> a sphere is outside the bounds of Science.” That sounds too much like saying “It’s fine to say dinosaur bones have such-and-such characteristics, but we must never speculate about what kind of process produced them, or whether it involved actual dinosaurs”.</p>\n<p><b id=\"V_\">V.</b></p>\n<p>My understanding of the multiverse debate is that it works the same way. Scientists observe the behavior of particles, and find that a multiverse explains that behavior more simply and elegantly than not-a-multiverse.</p>\n<p>One (doubtless exaggerated) way I’ve heard multiverse proponents <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-many-worlds-theory-of-hugh-everett-split-the-universe\">explain their position</a> is like this: in certain situations the math declares two contradictory answers – in the classic example, Schrodinger’s cat will be both alive and dead. But when we open the box, we see only a dead cat or an alive cat, not both. Multiverse opponents say “Some unknown force steps in at the last second and destroys one of the possibility branches”. Multiverse proponents say “No it doesn’t, both possibility branches happen exactly the way the math says, and we end up in one of them.”</p>\n<p>Taking this exaggerated dumbed-down account as exactly right, this sounds about as hard as the dinosaurs-vs-Satan example, in terms of figuring out which is more Occam’s Razor compliant. I’m sure the reality is more nuanced, but I think it can be judged by the same process. Perhaps this is the kind of reasoning that only gets us to a 90% probability there is a multiverse, rather than a 99.999999% one. But I think determining that theories have 90% probability is a reasonable scientific thing to do.</p>\n<p><b id=\"VI_\">VI.</b></p>\n<p>At times, the Aeon article seems to flirt with admitting that something like this is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Such problems were judged by philosophers of science to be insurmountable, and Popper’s falsifiability criterion was abandoned (though, curiously, it still lives on in the minds of many practising scientists). But rather than seek an alternative, in 1983 the philosopher Larry Laudan declared that the demarcation problem is actually intractable, and must therefore be a pseudo-problem. He argued that the real distinction is between knowledge that is reliable or unreliable, irrespective of its provenance, and claimed that terms such as ‘pseudoscience’ and ‘unscientific’ have no real meaning.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But it always jumps back from the precipice:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So, if we can’t make use of falsifiability, what do we use instead? I don’t think we have any real alternative but to adopt what I might call the empirical criterion. Demarcation is not some kind of binary yes-or-no, right-or-wrong, black-or-white judgment. We have to admit shades of grey. Popper himself was ready to accept this, [saying]:</p>\n<p><i>“The criterion of demarcation cannot be an absolutely sharp one but will itself have degrees. There will be well-testable theories, hardly testable theories, and non-testable theories. Those which are non-testable are of no interest to empirical scientists. They may be described as metaphysical.”</i></p>\n<p>Here, ‘testability’ implies only that a theory either makes contact, or holds some promise of making contact, with empirical evidence. It makes no presumptions about what we might do in light of the evidence. If the evidence verifies the theory, that’s great – we celebrate and start looking for another test. If the evidence fails to support the theory, then we might ponder for a while or tinker with the auxiliary assumptions. Either way, there’s a tension between the metaphysical content of the theory and the empirical data – a tension between the ideas and the facts – which prevents the metaphysics from getting completely out of hand. In this way, the metaphysics is tamed or ‘naturalised’, and we have something to work with. This is science.</p></blockquote>\n<p>But as we’ve seen, many things we really want to include as science are not testable: our credence for real dinosaurs over Satan planting fossils, our credence for Khafre building the Sphinx over Khufu or Atlanteans, or elegant patterns that explain the features of the universe like the Extradimensional-Sphere Theory. </p>\n<p>The Aeon article is aware of Carroll’s work – which, along with the paragraph quoted in Section II above, includes a lot of detailed Bayesian reasoning encompassing everything I’ve discussed. But the article dismisses it in a few sentences:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sean Carroll, a vocal advocate for the Many-Worlds interpretation, prefers abduction, or what he calls ‘inference to the best explanation’, which leaves us with theories that are merely ‘parsimonious’, a matter of judgment, and ‘still might reasonably be true’. But whose judgment? In the absence of facts, what constitutes ‘the best explanation’?</p>\n<p>Carroll seeks to dress his notion of inference in the cloth of respectability provided by something called Bayesian probability theory, happily overlooking its entirely subjective nature. It’s a short step from here to the theorist-turned-philosopher Richard Dawid’s efforts to justify the string theory programme in terms of ‘theoretically confirmed theory’ and ‘non-empirical theory assessment’. The ‘best explanation’ is then based on a choice between purely metaphysical constructs, without reference to empirical evidence, based on the application of a probability theory that can be readily engineered to suit personal prejudices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>“A choice between purely metaphysical constructs, without reference to empirical evidence” sounds pretty bad, until you realize he’s talking about the same reasoning we use to determine that real dinosaurs are more likely than Satan planting fossils.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to go over the exact ways in which Bayesian methods are subjective (which I think are overestimated) vs. objective. I think it’s more fruitful to point out that your brain <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/\">is already using Bayesian methods</a> to interpret the photons striking your eyes into this sentence, to make snap decisions about what sense the words are used in, and to integrate them into your model of the world. If Bayesian methods are good enough to give you every single piece of evidence about the nature of the external world that you have ever encountered in your entire life, I say they’re good enough for science.</p>\n<p>Or if you don’t like that, you can use the explanation above, which barely uses the word “Bayes” at all and just describes everything in terms like “Occam’s Razor” and “you wouldn’t want to conclude something like that, would you?”</p>\n<p>I know there are separate debates about whether this kind of reasoning-from-simplicity is actually good enough, when used by ordinary people, to consistently arrive at truth. Or whether it’s a productive way to conduct science that will give us good new theories, or <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/71/flow/why-beauty-is-fatal-to-physics\">a waste of everybody’s time</a>. I sympathize with some these concerns, though I am nowhere near scientifically educated enough to have an actual opinion on the questions at play.</p>\n<p>But I think it’s important to argue that even before you describe the advantages and disadvantages of the complicated Bayesian math that lets you do this, <i>something like this has to be done</i>. The untestable is a fundamental part of science, impossible to remove. We can debate how to explain it. But denying it isn’t an option.</p>",

This is ‘post-empirical’ science, where truth no longer matters, and it is potentially very dangerous.\n> \n> It’s not difficult to find recent examples. On 8 June 2019, the front cover of New Scientist magazine boldly declared that we’re ‘Inside the Mirrorverse’. Its editors bid us ‘Welcome to the parallel reality that’s hiding in plain sight’. \\[…\\]\n> \n> \\[Some physicists\\] claim that neutrons \\[are\\] flitting between parallel universes. They admit that the chances of proving this are ‘low’, or even ‘zero’, but it doesn’t really matter. When it comes to grabbing attention, inviting that all-important click, or purchase, speculative metaphysics wins hands down.\n> \n> These theories are based on the notion that our Universe is not unique, that there exists a large number of other universes that somehow sit alongside or parallel to our own. For example, in the so-called Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, there are universes containing our parallel selves, identical to us but for their different experiences of quantum physics. These theories are attractive to some few theoretical physicists and philosophers, but there is absolutely no empirical evidence for them. And, as it seems we can’t ever experience these other universes, there will never be any evidence for them. As Broussard explained, these theories are sufficiently slippery to duck any kind of challenge that experimentalists might try to throw at them, and there’s always someone happy to keep the idea alive.\n> \n> Is this really science? The answer depends on what you think society needs from science. In our post-truth age of casual lies, fake news and alternative facts, society is under extraordinary pressure from those pushing potentially dangerous antiscientific propaganda – ranging from climate-change denial to the anti-vaxxer movement to homeopathic medicines. I, for one, prefer a science that is rational and based on evidence, a science that is concerned with theories and empirical facts, a science that promotes the search for truth, no matter how transient or contingent. I prefer a science that does not readily admit theories so vague and slippery that empirical tests are either impossible or they mean absolutely nothing at all.\n\nAs always, a single quote doesn’t do the argument justice, so go read the article. But I think this captures the basic argument: multiverse theories are bad, because they’re untestable, and untestable science is pseudoscience.\n\nMany great people, both philosophers of science and practicing scientists, have already discussed the problems with this point of view. But none of them lay out their argument in quite the way that makes the most sense to me. I want to do that here, without claiming any originality or special expertise in the subject, to see if it helps convince anyone else.\n\n**II.**\n\nConsider a classic example: modern paleontology does a good job at predicting dinosaur fossils. But the creationist explanation – Satan buried fake dinosaur fossils to mislead us – also predicts the same fossils (we assume Satan is good at disguising his existence, so that the lack of other strong evidence for Satan doesn’t contradict the theory). What principles help us realize that the Satan hypothesis is obviously stupid and the usual paleontological one more plausible?\n\nOne bad response: paleontology can better predict characteristics of dinosaur fossils, using arguments like “since plesiosaurs are aquatic, they will be found in areas that were underwater during the Mesozoic, but since tyrannosaurs are terrestrial, they will be found in areas that were on land”, and this makes it better than the Satan hypothesis, which can only retrodict these characteristics. But this isn’t quite true: since Satan is trying to fool us into believing the modern paleontology paradigm, he’ll hide the fossils in ways that conform to its predictions, so we will predict plesiosaur fossils will only be found at sea – otherwise the gig would be up!\n\nA second bad response: “The hypothesis that all our findings were planted to deceive us bleeds into conspiracy theories and touches on the problem of skepticism. These things are inherently outside the realm of science.” But archaeological findings are [very often deliberate hoaxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeological_forgery#Known_archaeological_forgeries_and_hoaxes) planted to deceive archaeologists, and in practice archaeologists consider and test that hypothesis the same way they consider and test every other hypothesis. Rule this out by fiat and we have to accept Piltdown Man, or at least claim that the people arguing against the veracity of Piltdown Man were doing something other than Science.\n\nA third bad response: “Satan is supernatural and science is not allowed to consider supernatural explanations.” Fine then, replace Satan with an alien. I think this is a stupid distinction – if demons really did interfere in earthly affairs, then we could investigate their actions using the same methods we use to investigate every other process. But this would take a long time to argue well, so for now let’s just stick with the alien.\n\nA fourth bad response: “There is no empirical test that distinguishes the Satan hypothesis from the paleontology hypothesis, therefore the Satan hypothesis is inherently unfalsifiable and therefore pseudoscientific.” But this can’t be right. After all, there’s no empirical test that distinguishes the paleontology hypothesis from the Satan hypothesis! If we call one of them pseudoscience based on their inseparability, we have to call the other one pseudoscience too!\n\nA naive Popperian (which maybe nobody really is) would have to stop here, and say that we predict dinosaur fossils will have such-and-such characteristics, but that questions like that process that drives this pattern – a long-dead ecosystem of actual dinosaurs, or the Devil planting dinosaur bones to deceive us – is a mystical question beyond the ability of Science to even conceivably solve.\n\nI think the correct response is to say that both theories explain the data, and one cannot *empirically* test which theory is true, but the paleontology theory *is more elegant* (I am tempted to say “simpler”, but that might imply I have a rigorous mathematical definition of the form of simplicity involved, which I don’t). It requires fewer other weird things to be true. It involves fewer other hidden variables. It transforms our worldview less. It gets a cleaner shave with Occam’s Razor. This elegance is so important to us that it explains our vast preference for the first theory over the second.\n\nA long tradition of philosophers of science have already written eloquently about this, summed up by Sean Carroll [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05016.pdf):\n\n> What makes an explanation “the best.” Thomas Kuhn ,after his influential book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions led many people to think of him as a relativist when it came to scientific claims, attempted to correct this misimpression by offering a list of criteria that scientists use in practice to judge one theory better than another one: accuracy, consistency, broad scope, simplicity, and fruitfulness. “Accuracy” (fitting the data) is one of these criteria, but by no means the sole one. Any working scientist can think of cases where each of these concepts has been invoked in favor of one theory or another. But there is no unambiguous algorithm according to which we can feed in these criteria, a list of theories, and a set of data, and expect the best theory to pop out. The way in which we judge scientific theories is inescapably reflective, messy, and human. That’s the reality of how science is actually done; it’s a matter of judgment, not of drawing bright lines between truth and falsity or science and non-science. Fortunately, in typical cases the accumulation of evidence eventually leaves only one viable theory in the eyes of most reasonable observers.\n\nThe dinosaur hypothesis and the Satan hypothesis both fit the data, but the dinosaur hypothesis wins hands-down on simplicity. As Carroll predicts, most reasonable observers are able to converge on the same solution here, despite the philosophical complexity.\n\n**III.**\n\nI’m starting with this extreme case because its very extremity makes it easier to see the mechanism in action. But I think the same process applies to other cases that people really worry about.\n\nConsider the riddle of the Sphinx. There’s pretty good archaeological evidence supporting the consensus position that it was built by Pharaoh Khafre. But there are a few holes in that story, and a few scattered artifacts suggest it was actually built by Pharaoh Khufu; a respectable minority of archaeologists believe this. And there are a few anomalies which, if taken wildly out of context, you can use to tell a story that it was built long before Egypt existed at all, maybe by Atlantis or aliens.\n\nSo there are three competing hypotheses. All of them are consistent with current evidence (even the Atlantis one, which was written after the current evidence was found and carefully adds enough epicycles not to blatantly contradict it). Perhaps one day evidence will come to light that supports one above the others; maybe in some unexcavated tomb, a hieroglyphic tablet says “I created the Sphinx, sincerely yours, Pharaoh Khufu”. But maybe this won’t happen. Maybe we already have all the Sphinx-related evidence we’re going to get. Maybe the information necessary to distinguish among these hypotheses has been utterly lost beyond any conceivable ability to reconstruct.\n\nI don’t want to say “No hypothesis can be tested any further, so Science is useless to us here”, because then we’re forced to conclude stupid things like “Science has no opinion on whether the Sphinx was built by Khafre or Atlanteans,” whereas I think most scientists would actually have very strong opinions on that.\n\nBut what about the question of whether the Sphinx was built by Khafre or Khufu? This is a real open question with respectable archaeologists on both sides; what can we do about it?\n\nI think the answer would have to be: the same thing we did with the Satan vs. paleontology question, only now it’s a lot harder. We try to figure out which theory requires fewer other weird things to be true, fewer hidden variables, less transformation of our worldview – which theory works better with Occam’s Razor. This is relatively easy in the Atlantis case, and hard but *potentially possible* in the Khafre vs. Khufu case.\n\n(Bayesians can rephrase this to: given that we have a certain amount of evidence for each, can we quantify exactly how much evidence, and what our priors for each should be. It would end not with a decisive victory of one or the other, but with a probability distribution, maybe 80% chance it was Khafre, 20% chance it was Khufu)\n\nI think this is a totally legitimate thing for Egyptologists to do, even if it never results in a particular testable claim that gets tested. If you don’t think it’s a legitimate thing for Egyptologists to do, I have trouble figuring out how you can justify Egyptologists rejecting the Atlantis theory.\n\n(Again, Bayesians would start with a very low prior for Atlantis, and assess the evidence as very low, and end up with a probability distribution something like Khafre 80%, Khufu 19.999999%, Atlantis 0.000001%)\n\n**IV.**\n\nHow does this relate to things like multiverse theory? Before we get there, one more hokey example:\n\nSuppose scientists measure the mass of one particle at 32.604 units, the mass of another related particle at 204.897 units, and the mass of a third related particle at 4452.767 units. For a while, this is just how things are – it seems to be an irreducible brute fact about the universe. Then some theorist notices that if you set the mass of the first particle as x, then the second is 2πx and the third is 4/3 πx^2. They theorize that perhaps the quantum field forms some sort of extradimensional sphere, the first particle represents a diameter of a great circle of the sphere, the second the circumference of the great circle, and the third the volume of the sphere.\n\n(please excuse the stupidity of my example, I don’t know enough about physics to come up with something that isn’t stupid, but I hope it will illustrate my point)\n\nIn fact, imagine that there are a hundred different particles, all with different masses, and all one hundred have masses that perfectly correspond to various mathematical properties of spheres.\n\nIs the person who made this discovery doing Science? And should we consider their theory a useful contribution to physics?\n\nI think the answer is clearly yes. But consider what this commits us to. Suppose the scientist came up with their Extradimensional Sphere hypothesis *after* learning the masses of the relevant particles, and so it has not predicted anything. Suppose the extradimensional sphere is outside normal space, curled up into some dimension we can’t possibly access or test without a particle accelerator the size of the moon. Suppose there are no undiscovered particles in this set that can be tested to see if they also reflect sphere-related parameters. This theory is exactly the kind of postempirical, metaphysical construct that the Aeon article savages.\n\nBut it’s really compelling. We have a hundred different particles, and this theory retrodicts the properties of each of them perfectly. And it’s so simple – just say the word “sphere” and the rest falls out naturally! You would have to be crazy not to think it was at least pretty plausible, or that the scientist who developed it had done some good work.\n\nNor do I think it seems right to say “The discovery that all of our unexplained variables perfectly match the parameters of a sphere is good, but the hypothesis that there *really is* a sphere is outside the bounds of Science.” That sounds too much like saying “It’s fine to say dinosaur bones have such-and-such characteristics, but we must never speculate about what kind of process produced them, or whether it involved actual dinosaurs”.\n\n**V.**\n\nMy understanding of the multiverse debate is that it works the same way. Scientists observe the behavior of particles, and find that a multiverse explains that behavior more simply and elegantly than not-a-multiverse.\n\nOne (doubtless exaggerated) way I’ve heard multiverse proponents [explain their position](https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-many-worlds-theory-of-hugh-everett-split-the-universe) is like this: in certain situations the math declares two contradictory answers – in the classic example, Schrodinger’s cat will be both alive and dead. But when we open the box, we see only a dead cat or an alive cat, not both. Multiverse opponents say “Some unknown force steps in at the last second and destroys one of the possibility branches”. Multiverse proponents say “No it doesn’t, both possibility branches happen exactly the way the math says, and we end up in one of them.”\n\nTaking this exaggerated dumbed-down account as exactly right, this sounds about as hard as the dinosaurs-vs-Satan example, in terms of figuring out which is more Occam’s Razor compliant. I’m sure the reality is more nuanced, but I think it can be judged by the same process. Perhaps this is the kind of reasoning that only gets us to a 90% probability there is a multiverse, rather than a 99.999999% one. But I think determining that theories have 90% probability is a reasonable scientific thing to do.\n\n**VI.**\n\nAt times, the Aeon article seems to flirt with admitting that something like this is necessary:\n\n> Such problems were judged by philosophers of science to be insurmountable, and Popper’s falsifiability criterion was abandoned (though, curiously, it still lives on in the minds of many practising scientists). But rather than seek an alternative, in 1983 the philosopher Larry Laudan declared that the demarcation problem is actually intractable, and must therefore be a pseudo-problem. He argued that the real distinction is between knowledge that is reliable or unreliable, irrespective of its provenance, and claimed that terms such as ‘pseudoscience’ and ‘unscientific’ have no real meaning.\n\nBut it always jumps back from the precipice:\n\n> So, if we can’t make use of falsifiability, what do we use instead? I don’t think we have any real alternative but to adopt what I might call the empirical criterion. Demarcation is not some kind of binary yes-or-no, right-or-wrong, black-or-white judgment. We have to admit shades of grey. Popper himself was ready to accept this, \\[saying\\]:\n> \n> *“The criterion of demarcation cannot be an absolutely sharp one but will itself have degrees. There will be well-testable theories, hardly testable theories, and non-testable theories. Those which are non-testable are of no interest to empirical scientists. They may be described as metaphysical.”*\n> \n> Here, ‘testability’ implies only that a theory either makes contact, or holds some promise of making contact, with empirical evidence. It makes no presumptions about what we might do in light of the evidence. If the evidence verifies the theory, that’s great – we celebrate and start looking for another test. If the evidence fails to support the theory, then we might ponder for a while or tinker with the auxiliary assumptions. Either way, there’s a tension between the metaphysical content of the theory and the empirical data – a tension between the ideas and the facts – which prevents the metaphysics from getting completely out of hand. In this way, the metaphysics is tamed or ‘naturalised’, and we have something to work with. This is science.\n\nBut as we’ve seen, many things we really want to include as science are not testable: our credence for real dinosaurs over Satan planting fossils, our credence for Khafre building the Sphinx over Khufu or Atlanteans, or elegant patterns that explain the features of the universe like the Extradimensional-Sphere Theory.\n\nThe Aeon article is aware of Carroll’s work – which, along with the paragraph quoted in Section II above, includes a lot of detailed Bayesian reasoning encompassing everything I’ve discussed. But the article dismisses it in a few sentences:\n\n> Sean Carroll, a vocal advocate for the Many-Worlds interpretation, prefers abduction, or what he calls ‘inference to the best explanation’, which leaves us with theories that are merely ‘parsimonious’, a matter of judgment, and ‘still might reasonably be true’. But whose judgment? In the absence of facts, what constitutes ‘the best explanation’?\n> \n> Carroll seeks to dress his notion of inference in the cloth of respectability provided by something called Bayesian probability theory, happily overlooking its entirely subjective nature. It’s a short step from here to the theorist-turned-philosopher Richard Dawid’s efforts to justify the string theory programme in terms of ‘theoretically confirmed theory’ and ‘non-empirical theory assessment’. The ‘best explanation’ is then based on a choice between purely metaphysical constructs, without reference to empirical evidence, based on the application of a probability theory that can be readily engineered to suit personal prejudices.\n\n“A choice between purely metaphysical constructs, without reference to empirical evidence” sounds pretty bad, until you realize he’s talking about the same reasoning we use to determine that real dinosaurs are more likely than Satan planting fossils.\n\nI don’t want to go over the exact ways in which Bayesian methods are subjective (which I think are overestimated) vs. objective. I think it’s more fruitful to point out that your brain [is already using Bayesian methods](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/) to interpret the photons striking your eyes into this sentence, to make snap decisions about what sense the words are used in, and to integrate them into your model of the world. If Bayesian methods are good enough to give you every single piece of evidence about the nature of the external world that you have ever encountered in your entire life, I say they’re good enough for science.\n\nOr if you don’t like that, you can use the explanation above, which barely uses the word “Bayes” at all and just describes everything in terms like “Occam’s Razor” and “you wouldn’t want to conclude something like that, would you?”\n\nI know there are separate debates about whether this kind of reasoning-from-simplicity is actually good enough, when used by ordinary people, to consistently arrive at truth. Or whether it’s a productive way to conduct science that will give us good new theories, or [a waste of everybody’s time](http://nautil.us/issue/71/flow/why-beauty-is-fatal-to-physics). I sympathize with some these concerns, though I am nowhere near scientifically educated enough to have an actual opinion on the questions at play.\n\nBut I think it’s important to argue that even before you describe the advantages and disadvantages of the complicated Bayesian math that lets you do this, *something like this has to be done*. The untestable is a fundamental part of science, impossible to remove. We can debate how to explain it. But denying it isn’t an option."

Every time someone does something that is anything other than the thing that maximizes their goal, you could view it as them optimizing some kind of proxy (and the action to maximize the proxy is not the same as the action to maximize the goal).</p><p><u>R<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean\">egression to the Mean</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s_curse\">Winner’s Curse</a></u>, and <u><a href=\"https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jes9/bio/The_Optimizers_Curse.pdf\">Optimizer’s Curse</a></u> are all examples of Regressional Goodhart, as is <u><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/\">the Tails Come Apart</a></u> phenomenon.</p><h2 id=\"Relationship_with_Other_Goodhart_Phenomena\">Relationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena</h2><p>Regressional Goodhart is by far the most benign of the four Goodhart effects. It is also the hardest to avoid, as it shows up every time the proxy and the goal are not exactly the same.</p><h2 id=\"Mitigation\">Mitigation</h2><p>When facing only Regressional Goodhart, you still want to choose the option with the largest proxy value. While the proxy will be an overestimate it will still be better in expectation than options with a smaller proxy value. If you have control over what proxies to use, you can mitigate Regressional Goodhart by choosing proxies that are more tightly correlated with your goal. </p><p>If you are not just trying to pick the best option, but also trying to have an accurate picture of what the true value will be, Regressional Goodhart may cause you to overestimate the value. If you know the exact relationship between the proxy and the goal, you can account for this by just calculating the expected goal value for a given proxy value. If you have access to a second proxy with an error independent from the error in the first proxy, you can use the first proxy to optimize, and the second proxy to get an accurate expectation of the true value. (This is what happens when you set aside some training data to use for testing.)</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><h1 id=\"Causal_Goodhart\">Causal Goodhart</h1><p>When there is a non-causal correlation between the proxy and the goal, intervening on the proxy may fail to intervene on the goal.</p><h2 id=\"Abstract_Model1\">Abstract Model</h2><p>If <span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

Most AI is not in acting in the kind of environment where Causal Goodhart would be a problem, and when it is acting in that kind of environment Causal Goodhart errors are easily avoided.</p><p>Most of the time the phrase \"Correlation does not imply causation\" is used it is pointing out that a proposed policy might be subject to Causal Goodhart. </p><h2 id=\"Relationship_with_Other_Goodhart_Phenomena1\">Relationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena</h2><p>You can tell the difference between Causal Goodhart and the other three types because Causal Goodhart goes away when just sample a world with large proxy value, rather than intervene to cause the proxy to happen.</p><h2 id=\"Mitigation1\">Mitigation</h2><p>One way to avoid Causal Goodhart is to only sample from or choose between worlds according to their proxy values, rather than causing the proxy. This clearly cannot be done in all situations, but it is useful to note that there is a class of problems for which Causal Goodhart cannot cause problems. For example, consider choosing between algorithms based on how well they do on some test inputs, and your goal is to choose an algorithm that performs well on random inputs. The fact that you choose an algorithm does not effect its performance, and you don't have to worry about Causal Goodhart.</p><p>In cases where you actually change the proxy value, you can try to infer the causal structure of the variables using statistical methods, and check that the proxy actually causes the goal before you intervene on the proxy.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"><h1 id=\"Extremal_Goodhart\">Extremal Goodhart</h1><p>Worlds in which the proxy takes an extreme value may be very different from the ordinary worlds in which the correlation between the proxy and the goal was observed.</p><h2 id=\"Abstract_Model2\">Abstract Model</h2><p>Patterns tend to break at simple joints.

      "markdown": "[Goodhart’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) states that \"any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.\" However, this is not a single phenomenon. I propose that there are (at least) four different mechanisms through which proxy measures break when you optimize for them.\n\nThe four types are Regressional, Causal, Extremal, and Adversarial. In this post, I will go into detail about these four different Goodhart effects using mathematical abstractions as well as examples involving humans and/or AI. I will also talk about how you can mitigate each effect.\n\nThroughout the post, I will use < refresh to render LaTeX > to refer to the true goal and use < refresh to render LaTeX > to refer to a proxy for that goal which was observed to correlate with < refresh to render LaTeX > and which is being optimized in some way.\n\n* * *\n\nQuick Reference\n===============\n\n*   Regressional Goodhart - When selecting for a proxy measure, you select not only for the true goal, but also for the difference between the proxy and the goal.\n\n*   Model: When < refresh to render LaTeX > is equal to < refresh to render LaTeX > , where < refresh to render LaTeX > is some noise, a point with a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value will likely have a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value, but also a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value. Thus, when < refresh to render LaTeX > is large, you can expect < refresh to render LaTeX > to be predictably smaller than < refresh to render LaTeX > .\n*   _Example: height is correlated with basketball ability, and does actually directly help, but the best player is only 6'3\", and a random 7' person in their 20s would probably not be as good_\n\n*   Causal Goodhart - When there is a non-causal correlation between the proxy and the goal, intervening on the proxy may fail to intervene on the goal.\n\n*   Model: If < refresh to render LaTeX > causes < refresh to render LaTeX > (or if < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > are both caused by some third thing), then a correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > may be observed. However, when you intervene to increase < refresh to render LaTeX > through some mechanism that does not involve < refresh to render LaTeX > , you will fail to also increase < refresh to render LaTeX > .\n*   _Example: someone who wishes to be taller might observe that height is correlated with basketball skill and decide to start practicing basketball._\n\n*   Extremal Goodhart - Worlds in which the proxy takes an extreme value may be very different from the ordinary worlds in which the correlation between the proxy and the goal was observed.\n\n*   Model: Patterns tend to break at simple joints. One simple subset of worlds is those worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large. Thus, a strong correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > observed for naturally occuring < refresh to render LaTeX > values may not transfer to worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large. Further, since there may be relatively few naturally occuring worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large, extremely large < refresh to render LaTeX > may coincide with small < refresh to render LaTeX > values without breaking the statistical correlation.\n*   _Example: the tallest person on record,_ _[Robert Wadlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow), was 8'11\" (2.72m). He grew to that height because of a pituitary disorder, he would have struggled to play basketball because he \"required leg braces to walk and had little feeling in his legs and feet.\"_\n\n*   Adversarial Goodhart - When you optimize for a proxy, you provide an incentive for adversaries to correlate their goal with your proxy, thus destroying the correlation with your goal.\n\n*   Model: Consider an agent < refresh to render LaTeX > with some different goal < refresh to render LaTeX > . Since they depend on common resources, < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > are naturally opposed. If you optimize < refresh to render LaTeX > as a proxy for < refresh to render LaTeX > , and < refresh to render LaTeX > knows this, < refresh to render LaTeX > is incentivized to make large < refresh to render LaTeX > values coincide with large < refresh to render LaTeX > values, thus stopping them from coinciding with large < refresh to render LaTeX > values.\n*   _Example: aspiring NBA players might just lie about their height._\n\n* * *\n\nRegressional Goodhart\n=====================\n\nWhen selecting for a proxy measure, you select not only for the true goal, but also for the difference between the proxy and the goal.\n\nAbstract Model\n--------------\n\nWhen < refresh to render LaTeX > is equal to < refresh to render LaTeX > , where < refresh to render LaTeX > is some noise, a point with a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value will likely have a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value, but also a large < refresh to render LaTeX > value. Thus, when < refresh to render LaTeX > is large, you can expect < refresh to render LaTeX > to be predictably smaller than < refresh to render LaTeX > .\n\nThe above description is when < refresh to render LaTeX > is meant to be an estimate of < refresh to render LaTeX > . A similar effect can be seen when < refresh to render LaTeX > is only meant to be correlated with < refresh to render LaTeX > by looking at percentiles. When a sample is chosen which is a typical member of the top < refresh to render LaTeX > percent of all < refresh to render LaTeX > values, it will have a lower < refresh to render LaTeX > value than a typical member of the top < refresh to render LaTeX > percent of all < refresh to render LaTeX > values. As a special case, when you select the highest < refresh to render LaTeX > value, you will often not select the highest < refresh to render LaTeX > value.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nExamples of Regressional Goodhart are everywhere. Every time someone does something that is anything other than the thing that maximizes their goal, you could view it as them optimizing some kind of proxy (and the action to maximize the proxy is not the same as the action to maximize the goal).\n\nR[egression to the Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean), [Winner’s Curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner%27s_curse), and [Optimizer’s Curse](https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~jes9/bio/The_Optimizers_Curse.pdf) are all examples of Regressional Goodhart, as is [the Tails Come Apart](http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/) phenomenon.\n\nRelationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena\n------------------------------------------\n\nRegressional Goodhart is by far the most benign of the four Goodhart effects. It is also the hardest to avoid, as it shows up every time the proxy and the goal are not exactly the same.\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\nWhen facing only Regressional Goodhart, you still want to choose the option with the largest proxy value. While the proxy will be an overestimate it will still be better in expectation than options with a smaller proxy value. If you have control over what proxies to use, you can mitigate Regressional Goodhart by choosing proxies that are more tightly correlated with your goal.\n\nIf you are not just trying to pick the best option, but also trying to have an accurate picture of what the true value will be, Regressional Goodhart may cause you to overestimate the value. If you know the exact relationship between the proxy and the goal, you can account for this by just calculating the expected goal value for a given proxy value. If you have access to a second proxy with an error independent from the error in the first proxy, you can use the first proxy to optimize, and the second proxy to get an accurate expectation of the true value. (This is what happens when you set aside some training data to use for testing.)\n\n* * *\n\nCausal Goodhart\n===============\n\nWhen there is a non-causal correlation between the proxy and the goal, intervening on the proxy may fail to intervene on the goal.\n\nAbstract Model\n--------------\n\nIf < refresh to render LaTeX > causes < refresh to render LaTeX > (or if < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > are both caused by some third thing), then a correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > may be observed. However, when you intervene to increase < refresh to render LaTeX > through some mechanism that does not involve < refresh to render LaTeX > , you will fail to also increase V.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nHumans often avoid naive Causal Goodhart errors, and most examples I can think of sound obnoxious (like eating caviar to become rich). One possible example is a human who avoids doctor visits because not being told about health is a proxy for being healthy. (I do not know enough about humans to know if Causal Goodhart is actually what is going on here.)\n\nI also cannot think of a good AI example. Most AI is not in acting in the kind of environment where Causal Goodhart would be a problem, and when it is acting in that kind of environment Causal Goodhart errors are easily avoided.\n\nMost of the time the phrase \"Correlation does not imply causation\" is used it is pointing out that a proposed policy might be subject to Causal Goodhart.\n\nRelationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena\n------------------------------------------\n\nYou can tell the difference between Causal Goodhart and the other three types because Causal Goodhart goes away when just sample a world with large proxy value, rather than intervene to cause the proxy to happen.\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\nOne way to avoid Causal Goodhart is to only sample from or choose between worlds according to their proxy values, rather than causing the proxy. This clearly cannot be done in all situations, but it is useful to note that there is a class of problems for which Causal Goodhart cannot cause problems. For example, consider choosing between algorithms based on how well they do on some test inputs, and your goal is to choose an algorithm that performs well on random inputs. The fact that you choose an algorithm does not effect its performance, and you don't have to worry about Causal Goodhart.\n\nIn cases where you actually change the proxy value, you can try to infer the causal structure of the variables using statistical methods, and check that the proxy actually causes the goal before you intervene on the proxy.\n\n* * *\n\nExtremal Goodhart\n=================\n\nWorlds in which the proxy takes an extreme value may be very different from the ordinary worlds in which the correlation between the proxy and the goal was observed.\n\nAbstract Model\n--------------\n\nPatterns tend to break at simple joints. One simple subset of worlds is those worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large. Thus, a strong correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > observed for naturally occuring < refresh to render LaTeX > values may not transfer to worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large. Further, since there may be relatively few naturally occuring worlds in which < refresh to render LaTeX > is very large, extremely large < refresh to render LaTeX > may coincide with small < refresh to render LaTeX > values without breaking the statistical correlation.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nHumans evolve to like sugars, because sugars were correlated in the ancestral environment (which has fewer sugars) with nutrition and survival. Humans then optimize for sugars, have way too much, and become less healthy.\n\nAs an abstract mathematical example, let < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > be two correlated dimensions in a multivariate normal distribution, but we cut off the normal distribution to only include the ball of points in which < refresh to render LaTeX > for some large < refresh to render LaTeX > . This example represents a correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > in naturally occurring points, but also a boundary around what types of points are feasible that need not respect this correlation. Imagine you were to sample < refresh to render LaTeX > points and take the one with the largest < refresh to render LaTeX > value. As you increase < refresh to render LaTeX > , at first, this optimization pressure lets you find better and better points for both < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > , but as you increase < refresh to render LaTeX > to infinity, eventually you sample so many points that you will find a point near < refresh to render LaTeX > . When enough optimization pressure was applied, the correlation between < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > stopped mattering, and instead the boundary of what kinds of points were possible at all decided what kind of point was selected.\n\nMany examples of machine learning algorithms doing bad because of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) are a special case of Extremal Goodhart.\n\nRelationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena\n------------------------------------------\n\nExtremal Goodhart differs from Regressional Goodhart in that Extremal Goodhart goes away in simple examples like correlated dimensions in a multivariate normal distribution, but Regressional Goodhart does not.\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\nQuantilization and Regularization are both useful for mitigating Extremal Goodhart effects. In general, Extremal Goodhart can be mitigated by choosing an option with a high proxy value, but not so high as to take you to a domain drastically different from the one in which the proxy was learned.\n\n* * *\n\nAdversarial Goodhart\n====================\n\nWhen you optimize for a proxy, you provide an incentive for adversaries to correlate their goal with your proxy, thus destroying the correlation with your goal.\n\nAbstract Model\n--------------\n\nConsider an agent < refresh to render LaTeX > with some different goal < refresh to render LaTeX > . Since they depend on common resources, < refresh to render LaTeX > and < refresh to render LaTeX > are naturally opposed. If you optimize < refresh to render LaTeX > as a proxy for < refresh to render LaTeX > , and < refresh to render LaTeX > knows this, < refresh to render LaTeX > is incentivized to make large < refresh to render LaTeX > values coincide with large < refresh to render LaTeX > values, thus stopping them from coinciding with large < refresh to render LaTeX > values.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nWhen you use a metric to choose between people, but then those people learn what metric you use and game that metric, this is an example of Adversarial Goodhart.\n\nAdversarial Goodhart is the mechanism behind a superintelligent AI making a [Treacherous Turn](http://lesswrong.com/lw/n5k/a_toy_model_of_the_treacherous_turn/). Here, < refresh to render LaTeX > is doing what the humans want forever. < refresh to render LaTeX > is doing what the humans want in the training cases where the AI does not have enough power to take over, and < refresh to render LaTeX > is whatever the AI wants to do with the universe.\n\nAdversarial Goodhart is also behind the [malignancy of the universal prior](https://ordinaryideas.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/what-does-the-universal-prior-actually-look-like/), where you want to predict well forever ( < refresh to render LaTeX > ), so hypotheses might predict well for a while ( < refresh to render LaTeX > ), so that they can manipulate the world with their future predictions ( < refresh to render LaTeX > ).\n\nRelationship with Other Goodhart Phenomena\n------------------------------------------\n\nAdversarial Goodhart is the primary mechanism behind the original Goodhart's Law.\n\nExtremal Goodhart can happen even without any adversaries in the environment. However, Adversarial Goodhart may take advantage of Extremal Goodhart, as an adversary can more easily manipulate a small number of worlds with extreme proxy values, than it can manipulate all of the worlds.\n\nMitigation\n----------\n\nSuccesfully avoiding Adversarial Goodhart problems is very difficult in theory, and we understand very little about how to do this. In the case of non-superintelligent adversaries, you may be able to avoid Adversarial Goodhart by keeping your proxies secret (for example, not telling your employees what metrics you are using to evaluate them). However, this is unlikely to scale to dealing with superintelligent adversaries.\n\nOne technique that might help in mitigating Adversarial Goodhart is to choose a proxy that is so simple and optimize so hard that adversaries have no or minimal control over the world which maximizes that proxy. (I want to ephasize that this is not a good plan for avoiding Adversarial Goodhart; it is just all I have.)\n\nFor example, say you have a complicated goal that includes wanting to go to Mars. If you use a complicated search process to find a plan that is likely to get you to Mars, adversaries in your search process may suggest a plan that involves building a superintelligence that gets you to Mars, but also kills you.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use the proxy of getting to Mars as fast as possible and optimize very hard, then (maybe) adversaries can't add baggage to a proposed plan without being out selected by a plan without that baggage. Buliding a superintelligence maybe takes more time than just having the plan tell you how to build a rocket quickly. (Note that the plan will likely include things like acceleration that humans can't handle and nanobots that don't turn off, so Extremal Goodhart will still kill you.)"

href=\"/user/lukeprog/\">Luke’s</a> <a href=\"/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/\">“Crash Course in the Neuroscience of Human Motivation.”</a> It is a useful text, although there are a few technical errors and a few bits of outdated information (see [1], updated information about one particular quibble in [2] and [3]).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is one significant missing piece, however, which is of critical importance for our subject matter here on LW: the effect of attention on plasticity, including the plasticity of motivation. Since I don’t see any other texts addressing it directly (certainly not from a neuroscientific perspective), let’s cover the main idea here.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summary for impatient readers: focus of attention physically determines which synapses in your brain get stronger, and which areas of your cortex physically grow in size. The implications of this provide direct guidance for alteration of behaviors and motivational patterns. This <em>is</em> used for this purpose extensively: for instance, many benefits of the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy approach rely on this mechanism.<a id=\"more\"></a></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong id=\"I___Attention_and_plasticity\">I – Attention and plasticity</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To illustrate this properly, we need to define two terms. I’m guessing these are very familiar to most readers here, but let’s cover them briefly just in case.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">First thing to keep in mind is <em>the</em> <em>plasticity of cortical maps.</em> In essence, particular functional areas of our brain can expand or shrink based on how often (and how intensely) they are used. A small amount of this growth is physical, as new axons grow, expanding the white matter; most of it happens by repurposing any less-used circuitry in the vicinity of the active area. For example, our sense of sight is processed by our visual cortex, which turns signals from our eyes into lines, shapes, colors and movement. In blind people, however, this part of the brain becomes invaded by other senses, and begins to process sensations like touch and hearing, such that they become significantly more sensitive than in sighted people. Similarly, in deaf people, auditory cortex (part of the brain that processes sounds) becomes adapted to process visual information and gather language clues by sight.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second concept we’ll need is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex\"><em>somatosensory cortex</em></a> (SSC for short). This is an area of the (vertebrate) brain where most of the incoming touch and positional (proprioceptive) sensations from the body converge. There is a map-like quality to this part of our brain, as every body part links to a particular bit of the SSC surface (which can be illustrated with silly-looking things, such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensory_Homunculus.png\">sensory homunculus</a>). More touch-sensitive areas of the body have larger corresponding areas within the SSC.</p>\n<p>With these two in mind, let’s consider one actual experiment [4]. Scientists measured and mapped the area of an owl monkey’s SSC which became activated when one of his fingertips was touched. The monkey was then trained to hold that finger on a tactile stimulator – a moving wheel that stimulates touch receptors. The monkey had to pay attention to the stimulus, and was rewarded for letting go upon detecting certain changes in spinning frequency. After a few weeks of training, the area was measured again.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you probably expected, the area had grown larger. The touch-processing neurons grew out, co-opting surrounding circuitry in order to achieve better and faster processing of the stimulus that produced the reward. Which is, so far, just another way of showing plasticity of cortical maps.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But then, there is something else.

When we are learning to drive, we have to pay attention to everything: when to push the pedals, when to signal, where to hold our hands… A few years later, these behaviors become so automatic, we hardly pay attention at all. Indeed, most of us can drive for hours while carrying on conversations or listening to audiobooks. We are completely unaware, as our own body keeps pushing pedals, signaling turns, and changing gears.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can therefore say that <em>driving behaviors</em>, through practice and attention, eventually become automatic – which is, most of the time, a good thing. But so do many other things, including some destructive ones we might want to get rid of. Let’s take a simple one: nail biting. You are reading, or watching a movie, or thinking, or driving… when you suddenly notice some minor pain, and realize that you have chewed your nail into a ragged stump. Ouch!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">You catch yourself biting, you stop. Five minutes later, you catch yourself biting again. You stop again. Repeat <em>ad infinitum</em>, or <em>ad nauseam</em>, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy has a highly successful approach for breaking habits, which requires only a very subtle alteration to this process. You notice that you are biting your nails. You immediately focus your attention on what you are doing, and you stop doing it. No rage, no blaming yourself, no negative emotions. You just stop, and you focus all the attention you can on the act of stopping. You move your arm down, focusing your attention on the act of movement, on the feeling of your arm going down, away from your mouth. That’s it. You can go back to whatever you were doing.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Five minutes later, you notice yourself biting your nails again. You calmly repeat the procedure again.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">By doing this, you are training yourself to perform a new behavior – the “stop and put the hand down” behavior – which is itself triggered by the nail-biting behavior. As you go along, you will get better and better at noticing that you have started to bite your nails. You will also get better and better at stopping and putting your hand down. After a while, this will become semi-automatic; you’ll notice that your hand went to your mouth, a nail touched your tooth, and the hand went back down before you could do anything. Don’t stop training: focus your attention on the “stop and drop” part of the action.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a while, the nail-biting simply goes away. Of course, the more complex and more ingrained a habit is, the more effort and time will be needed to break it. But for most people, even strong habits can be relatively quickly weakened, or redirected into less destructive behaviors.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It’s probably obvious that habits can be <em>created</em> in this way as well. We don’t become better at things we do – we become better at things we <em>pay attention to while we’re doing them.</em> If you want to make exercise a habit, your efforts will be much more effective if you focus your attention on your exercise technique, rather than repeatedly thinking how painful and tiring the whole process is.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is also a direct implication for training in any complex skill. Start with the well-known <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve\">learning curve</a> effect: we gain a lot of skill relatively quickly, and then improvements slow down incrementally as we approach our maximum potential skill level. It is relatively easy to go from a poor to a mediocre tennis player; it is much, much harder to go from mediocre to good, and even harder to go from good to excellent.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Complex skills have many different aspects, which we usually attempt to train simultaneously. We can become very good at some, while staying poor at others. The optimal approach would be to focus most of our attention on those aspects where our abilities are weakest, since smaller investments of time and effort will lead to larger improvements in skill.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">To keep with the tennis metaphor, one could become very good at controlling the ball direction and spin, while still having a poor awareness of the opponent’s position. Simply playing more will improve both aspects further, but our hypothetical player should optimally try to focus her attention on opponent awareness [7].</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, there is another implication which I’ll leave as an exercise for the readers. Mindfulness meditation, which essentially boils down to training control of attention, has been shown to exert a positive effect on many, many different things (lowering depression, anxiety and stress, as well as improving productivity [8, 9, 10]). In the light of the previous text, one obvious reason why better control over attention can produce all these beneficial effects should immediately come to mind.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10pt; line-height: 115%;\">__________________________________________________</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">References</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">[1] I have several quibbles, but let’s stick to one (to prevent this note from becoming longer than the above text).

      "markdown": "I’ve just been reading [Luke’s](/user/lukeprog/) [“Crash Course in the Neuroscience of Human Motivation.”](/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/) It is a useful text, although there are a few technical errors and a few bits of outdated information (see \\[1\\], updated information about one particular quibble in \\[2\\] and \\[3\\]).\n\nThere is one significant missing piece, however, which is of critical importance for our subject matter here on LW: the effect of attention on plasticity, including the plasticity of motivation. Since I don’t see any other texts addressing it directly (certainly not from a neuroscientific perspective), let’s cover the main idea here.\n\nSummary for impatient readers: focus of attention physically determines which synapses in your brain get stronger, and which areas of your cortex physically grow in size. The implications of this provide direct guidance for alteration of behaviors and motivational patterns. This _is_ used for this purpose extensively: for instance, many benefits of the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy approach rely on this mechanism.\n\n**I – Attention and plasticity**\n\nTo illustrate this properly, we need to define two terms. I’m guessing these are very familiar to most readers here, but let’s cover them briefly just in case.\n\nFirst thing to keep in mind is _the_ _plasticity of cortical maps._ In essence, particular functional areas of our brain can expand or shrink based on how often (and how intensely) they are used. A small amount of this growth is physical, as new axons grow, expanding the white matter; most of it happens by repurposing any less-used circuitry in the vicinity of the active area. For example, our sense of sight is processed by our visual cortex, which turns signals from our eyes into lines, shapes, colors and movement. In blind people, however, this part of the brain becomes invaded by other senses, and begins to process sensations like touch and hearing, such that they become significantly more sensitive than in sighted people. Similarly, in deaf people, auditory cortex (part of the brain that processes sounds) becomes adapted to process visual information and gather language clues by sight.\n\nSecond concept we’ll need is [_somatosensory cortex_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_somatosensory_cortex) (SSC for short). This is an area of the (vertebrate) brain where most of the incoming touch and positional (proprioceptive) sensations from the body converge. There is a map-like quality to this part of our brain, as every body part links to a particular bit of the SSC surface (which can be illustrated with silly-looking things, such as the [sensory homunculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sensory_Homunculus.png)). More touch-sensitive areas of the body have larger corresponding areas within the SSC.\n\nWith these two in mind, let’s consider one actual experiment \\[4\\]. Scientists measured and mapped the area of an owl monkey’s SSC which became activated when one of his fingertips was touched. The monkey was then trained to hold that finger on a tactile stimulator – a moving wheel that stimulates touch receptors. The monkey had to pay attention to the stimulus, and was rewarded for letting go upon detecting certain changes in spinning frequency. After a few weeks of training, the area was measured again.\n\nAs you probably expected, the area had grown larger. The touch-processing neurons grew out, co-opting surrounding circuitry in order to achieve better and faster processing of the stimulus that produced the reward. Which is, so far, just another way of showing plasticity of cortical maps.\n\nBut then, there is something else. The SSC area expanded only when the monkey had to _pay attention_ to the sensation of touch in order to receive the reward. If a monkey was trained to keep a hand on the wheel that moved just the same, but he did not have to pay attention to it… the cortical map remained the same size. This finding has since been replicated in humans, many times (for instance \\[5, 6\\]).\n\nTake a moment to consider what this means.\n\nA man is sitting in his living room, in front of a chessboard. Classical music plays in the background. The man is focused, thinking about the next move, about his chess strategy, and about the future possibilities of the game. His neural networks are optimizing, making him a better chess player.\n\nA man is sitting in his living room, in front of a chessboard. Classical music plays in the background.

All you can meaningly infer is that <i>if</i> the system of gears is pretty simple (e.g., nothing that makes the righthand gear alternate as the lefthand gear rotates counterclockwise), then the direction that the righthand gear turns determines whether the total number of gears is even or odd.</li><li>The gear on the righthand side could just as well go either way. Your expectations aren't constrained.</li><li>Right now you <i>don't</i> know which way the righthand gear turns, and you can't derive it.</li></ul><p>Suppose that Joe peeks inside the box and tells you \"Oh, the righthand gear will rotate clockwise.\" You imagine that Joe is more likely to say this if the righthand gear turns clockwise than if it doesn't, so this seems like relevant evidence that the righthand gear turns clockwise. This gets stronger the more people like Joe who look in the box and report the same thing.</p><p>Now let's peek inside the box:</p><figure><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png/w_139 139w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png/w_219 219w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png/w_299 299w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png/w_379 379w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c0bb22994a178b465c279afd771d090ac6551063c28536d0.png/w_459 459w\"></figure><p>…and now we have to wonder what's up with Joe.</p><p>The second test stands out for me especially strongly. There is <i>no way</i> that the obvious model about what's going on here could be right <i>and</i> Joe is right. And it doesn't matter <i>how many people</i> agree with Joe in terms of the logic of this statement: Either <i>all of them are wrong</i>, or your model is wrong. This logic is immune to social pressure. It means that there's a chance that you can accumulate evidence about how well your map matches the territory here, and if that converges on your map being basically correct, then you are on firm epistemic footing to disregard the opinion of <i>lots</i> of other people.

Suppose the gear on the right really <i>does</i> move clockwise when you move the left gear counterclockwise. What does that imply? Well, it means your initial model (if it's what I imagine it is) is wrong — but there's a limited space of possibilities about <i>ways in which</i> it can be wrong. For instance, maybe the second gear from the left is on a vertical track and moves upward instead of rotating. By comparison, something like \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/\">Gears work in mysterious ways</a>\" just won't cut it.</p><p>If we combine the two, we end up staring at Joe and noticing that we can be a lot more precise than just \"Joe is wrong\". We know that either Joe's model of the gears is wrong (e.g., he thinks some gear is on a vertical track), Joe's model of the gears is <i>vague</i> and isn't constrained the way ours is (e.g., he was just counting gears and made a mistake), or Joe is lying. The first two give us testable predictions: If his model is wrong, then it's wrong <i>in some specific way</i>; and if it's vague, then there should be some place where it does poorly on the three tests of model interconnectedness. If we start zooming in on these two possibilities while talking to Joe and it turns out that neither of those are true, then it becomes a lot more obvious that Joe is just bullshitting (or we failed to think of a fourth option).</p><p>Because of this example, in CFAR we talk about how \"Gears-like\" or how \"made of Gears\" a model is.

Unfortunately, that's not what academia rewards, so <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">it probably isn't going to happen there</a>.)</p><p>I think Person A is trying to gesture at the claim that the student's model of the addition algorithm isn't made of Gears (and implicitly that it'd be better if it were). I think this clarifies both what A is saying and why it matters. In terms of the tests:</p><ul><li>The addition algorithm totally pays rent. E.g., if you count out 25 tokens and another 18 tokens and you then count the total number of tokens you get, that number should correspond to what the algorithm outputs. If it turned out that the student does the algorithm but the answer <i>doesn't</i> match the token count, then the student can only conclude that the addition algorithm isn't useful for the tokens. There isn't a lot else they can deduce. (By way of contrast, if I noticed this, then I'd conclude that either I'd made a mistake in running the algorithm or I'd made a mistake in counting, and I'd be very confident that at least one of those two things is true.)</li><li>The student could probably readily imagine a world in which you <i>aren't</i> supposed to carry the 1 but the algorithm still works. This means their model isn't very constrained, at least as we're imagining it. (Whereas attempting to think about carrying being <i>wrong</i> to do for getting the right answer makes my head explode.)</li><li>If the student forgot what their teacher said about what to do when a column adds up to more than nine, we imagine they wouldn't spontaneously notice the need to carry the 1. (If I forgot about carrying, though, I'd get <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/\">confused</a> about what to do with this extra ten and would come up with something mathematically equivalent to \"carrying the 1\".)</li></ul><p>I find this to be a useful <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/\">tabooing</a> of the word \"understand\" in this context.</p><hr><p><strong id=\"Example__My_mother\">Example: My mother</strong></p><p>My mother really likes learning about history.</p><p>Right now, this is probably an unattached random fact in your mind. Maybe a month down the road I could ask you \"How does my mother feel about learning history?\" and you could <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/\">try to remember</a> the answer, but you could <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/\">just as well believe the world works another way</a>.</p><p>But for me, that's not true at all. If I forgot her feelings about learning about history, I could make a pretty educated guess based on my overall sense of her. I wouldn't be Earth-shatteringly <i>shocked</i> to learn that she doesn't like reading about history, but I'd be really confused, and it'd throw into question my sense of why she likes working with herbs and why she likes hanging out with her family. It would make me think that I hadn't quite understood what kind of person my mother is.</p><p>As you might have noticed, this is an application of tests 1 and 3. In particular, my model of my mom isn't <i>totally made of</i> Gears in the sense that I could tell you what she's feeling right now or whether she defaults to thinking in terms of <a href=\"https://www.learner.org/courses/learningmath/number/session4/part_a/division.html\">partitive division or quotative division</a>. But the tests illustrate that my model of my mother is <i>more</i> Gears-like than <i>your</i> model of her.</p><p>Part of the point I'm making with this example is that \"Gears-ness\" isn't a binary property of models. It's more like a spectrum, from \"random smattering of unconnected facts\" to \"clear axiomatic system with well-defined logical deductions\". (Or at least that's how I'm currently imagining the spectrum!)</p><p>Also, I speculate that this is part of what we mean when we talk about \"getting to know\" someone: it involves increasing the Gears-ness of our model of them. It's not about just getting some isolated facts about where they work and how many kids they have and what they like doing for hobbies. It's about fleshing out an <i>ability to be surprised</i> if you were to learn some new fact about them that didn't fit your model of them.</p><p>(There's also an empirical question in getting to know someone of how well your Gears-ish model <i>actually matches</i> that person, but that's about the map/territory correspondence. I want to be careful to keep talking about properties of maps here.)</p><p>This lightly Gears-ish model of people is what I think lets you deduce what Mr. Rogers probably would have thought about, say, <a href=\"http://www.petful.com/behaviors/how-dangerous-is-halloween-for-black-cats/\">people mistreating cats on Halloween</a> even though I don't know if he ever talked about it. As per test #2, you'd probably be pretty shocked and confused if you were given compelling evidence that he had <i>joined in</i>, and I imagine it'd take a <i>lot</i> of evidence. And then you'd have to update a <i>lot</i> about how you view Mr. Rogers (as per test #1). I think a lot of people had this kind of \"Who even <i>is</i> this person?\" experience when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby_sexual_assault_allegations\">lots of criminal charges came out against Bill Cosby</a>.</p><hr><p><strong id=\"Example__Gyroscopes\">Example: Gyroscopes</strong></p><p>Most people feel visceral surprise when they watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zhP9Bnx-k#t=1m6s\">how gyroscopes behave</a>. Even if they <i>logically know</i> the suspended gyroscope will rotate instead of falling, they usually <i>feel</i> like it's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hs/think_like_reality/\">bizarre</a> somehow. Even people who get gyroscopes' behavior into their intuitions probably had to train it for a while first and found them surprising and counterintuitive.</p><p>Somehow, for most people, it seems coherent to imagine a world in which physics works exactly the same way <i>except that</i> when you suspend one end of a gyroscope, it falls like a non-spinning object would and just keeps spinning.</p><p>If this is true of you, that means your model of the physics around gyroscopes does poorly on test #2 of how Gears-like it is.</p><p>The <i>reason</i> gyroscopes do what they do is actually something you can derive from Newton's Laws of Motion. Like the gears example, you can't actually have a coherent model of rotation that allows (a) Newton's Laws and (b) a gyroscope that <i>doesn't</i> rotate instead of falling when suspended on one end in a gravitational field. So if both (a) and (b) seem plausible to you, then your model of rotation isn't coherent. It's missing Gears.</p><p>This is one of the beautiful (to me) things about physics: <i>everything</i> is made of Gears. Physics is (I think) the system of Gears you get when you stare at any physical object's behavior and ask \"What makes you do that?\" in a Gears-seeking kind of way. It's a different level of abstraction than the \"Gears of people\" thing, but we kind of expect that <i>eventually</i>, at least in theory, a sufficient extension of physics will connect the Gears of mechanics to the Gears of what makes a romantic relationship last while feeling good to be in.</p><p>I want to rush to clarify that I'm <i>not</i> saying that <i>the world</i> is made of Gears. That's a type error. I'm suggesting that <i>the property of Gears-ness in models</i> is tracking a true thing about the world, which is why making models more Gears-like can be so powerful.</p><hr><p><strong id=\"Gears_ness_is_not_the_same_as_goodness\">Gears-ness is not the same as goodness</strong></p><p>I want to emphasize that, while I think that more Gears are better all else being equal, there are other properties of models that I think are worthwhile.</p><p>The obvious one is accuracy. I've been intentionally sidestepping that property throughout most of this post. This is where the rationalist virtue of empiricism becomes critical, and I've basically ignored (but hopefully never defied!) empiricism here.</p><p>Another is <i>generativity</i>. Does the model <i>inspire a way of experiencing</i> in ways that are useful (whatever \"useful\" means)? For instance, many beliefs in God or the divine or similar are too abstract to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/\">pay rent</a>, but some people still find them helpful for reframing how they emotionally experience beauty, meaning, and other people. I know of a few ex-atheists who say that having <i>become</i> Christian causes them to be nicer people and has made their relationships better. I think there's reason for epistemic fear here to the extent that those religious frameworks <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey\">sneak in claims</a> about how the world actually works — but if you're epistemically careful, it seems possibly worthwhile to explore how to tap the power of faith without taking epistemic damage.</p><p>I also think that even if you're trying to lean on the Gears-like power of a model, lacking Gears doesn't mean that the activity is worthless. In fact, I think this is <i>all we can do</i> most of the time, because most of our models don't connect all the way down to physics. E.g., I'm thinking of getting my mother a particular book as a gift because I think she'll really like it, but I can <i>also</i> come up with a within-my-model-of-her story about why she might <i>not</i> really care about it. I don't think the fact that my model of her is weakly constrained means that (a) I shouldn't use the model or that (b) it's not worthwhile to explore the \"why\" behind both my being right and my being wrong. (I think of it as a bit of pre-computation: whichever way the world goes, my model becomes a little more \"crisp\", which is to say, more Gears-like. It just so happens that I know <i>in what way</i> beforehand.)</p><p>I mention this because sometimes in rationalist contexts, I've felt a pressure to <i>not talk about</i> models that are missing Gears. I don't like that. I think that Gears-ness is a <i>really super important</i> thing to track, and I think there's something epistemically dangerous about <i>failing to notice</i> a lack of Gears. Clearly noting, at least in your own mind, where there are and aren't Gears seems really good to me. But I think there are <i>other</i> capacities that are <i>also</i> important when we're trying to get epistemology right.</p><p>Gears seem valuable to me <i>for a reason</i>. I'd like us to keep that reason in mind rather than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">getting too fixated on Gears-ness</a>.</p><hr><p><strong id=\"Going_forward\">Going forward</strong></p><p>I think this frame of Gears-ness of models is super powerful for cutting through confusion. It helps our understanding of the world become immune to social foolishness and demands a kind of rigor to our thinking that I see as unifying lots of ideas in the Sequences.</p><p>I'll want to build on this frame as I highlight other ideas. In particular, I haven't spoken to <i>how we know Gears are worth looking for</i>. So while I view this as a powerful weapon to use in our war against <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/\">sanity drought</a>, I think it's <i>also</i> important to examine the smithy in which it was forged. I suspect that won't be my <i>very next</i> post, but it's one I have in mind upcoming.</p>",

Sometimes this is because of how well the [map corresponds to the territory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_map_is_not_the_territory), but sometimes it's because of features of the map that are irrespective of the territory. E.g., maybe the lines are fat and smudged such that you can't tell how far a road is from a river, or maybe it's unclear which road a name is trying to indicate.\n\nIn the same way, I want to point at a property of models that isn't about what they're modeling. It *interacts with* the clarity of what they're modeling, but only in the same way that smudged lines in a roadmap interact with the clarity of the roadmap.\n\nThis property is *how deterministically interconnected the variables of the model are*. There are a few [tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) I know of to see to what extent a model has this property, though I don't know if this list is exhaustive and would be a little surprised if it were:\n\n1.  Does the model [pay rent](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/)? If it does, and if it were falsified, how much (and how precisely) could you infer other things from the falsification?\n2.  How incoherent is it to imagine that the model is accurate but that a given variable [could be different](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/)?\n3.  If you knew the model were accurate but you were to forget the value of one variable, [could you rederive it](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/la/truly_part_of_you/)?\n\nI think this is a really important idea that ties together a lot of different topics that appear here on Less Wrong. It also acts as a prerequisite frame for a bunch of ideas and tools that I'll want to talk about later.\n\nI'll start by giving a bunch of examples.

Unfortunately, that's not what academia rewards, so [it probably isn't going to happen there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).)\n\nI think Person A is trying to gesture at the claim that the student's model of the addition algorithm isn't made of Gears (and implicitly that it'd be better if it were). I think this clarifies both what A is saying and why it matters. In terms of the tests:\n\n*   The addition algorithm totally pays rent. E.g., if you count out 25 tokens and another 18 tokens and you then count the total number of tokens you get, that number should correspond to what the algorithm outputs. If it turned out that the student does the algorithm but the answer *doesn't* match the token count, then the student can only conclude that the addition algorithm isn't useful for the tokens. There isn't a lot else they can deduce. (By way of contrast, if I noticed this, then I'd conclude that either I'd made a mistake in running the algorithm or I'd made a mistake in counting, and I'd be very confident that at least one of those two things is true.)\n*   The student could probably readily imagine a world in which you *aren't* supposed to carry the 1 but the algorithm still works. This means their model isn't very constrained, at least as we're imagining it. (Whereas attempting to think about carrying being *wrong* to do for getting the right answer makes my head explode.)\n*   If the student forgot what their teacher said about what to do when a column adds up to more than nine, we imagine they wouldn't spontaneously notice the need to carry the 1. (If I forgot about carrying, though, I'd get [confused](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/) about what to do with this extra ten and would come up with something mathematically equivalent to \"carrying the 1\".)\n\nI find this to be a useful [tabooing](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words/) of the word \"understand\" in this context.\n\n* * *\n\n**Example: My mother**\n\nMy mother really likes learning about history.\n\nRight now, this is probably an unattached random fact in your mind. Maybe a month down the road I could ask you \"How does my mother feel about learning history?\" and you could [try to remember](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/) the answer, but you could [just as well believe the world works another way](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/).\n\nBut for me, that's not true at all. If I forgot her feelings about learning about history, I could make a pretty educated guess based on my overall sense of her. I wouldn't be Earth-shatteringly *shocked* to learn that she doesn't like reading about history, but I'd be really confused, and it'd throw into question my sense of why she likes working with herbs and why she likes hanging out with her family. It would make me think that I hadn't quite understood what kind of person my mother is.\n\nAs you might have noticed, this is an application of tests 1 and 3. In particular, my model of my mom isn't *totally made of* Gears in the sense that I could tell you what she's feeling right now or whether she defaults to thinking in terms of [partitive division or quotative division](https://www.learner.org/courses/learningmath/number/session4/part_a/division.html). But the tests illustrate that my model of my mother is *more* Gears-like than *your* model of her.\n\nPart of the point I'm making with this example is that \"Gears-ness\" isn't a binary property of models. It's more like a spectrum, from \"random smattering of unconnected facts\" to \"clear axiomatic system with well-defined logical deductions\". (Or at least that's how I'm currently imagining the spectrum!)\n\nAlso, I speculate that this is part of what we mean when we talk about \"getting to know\" someone: it involves increasing the Gears-ness of our model of them. It's not about just getting some isolated facts about where they work and how many kids they have and what they like doing for hobbies. It's about fleshing out an *ability to be surprised* if you were to learn some new fact about them that didn't fit your model of them.\n\n(There's also an empirical question in getting to know someone of how well your Gears-ish model *actually matches* that person, but that's about the map/territory correspondence. I want to be careful to keep talking about properties of maps here.)\n\nThis lightly Gears-ish model of people is what I think lets you deduce what Mr. Rogers probably would have thought about, say, [people mistreating cats on Halloween](http://www.petful.com/behaviors/how-dangerous-is-halloween-for-black-cats/) even though I don't know if he ever talked about it. As per test #2, you'd probably be pretty shocked and confused if you were given compelling evidence that he had *joined in*, and I imagine it'd take a *lot* of evidence. And then you'd have to update a *lot* about how you view Mr. Rogers (as per test #1). I think a lot of people had this kind of \"Who even *is* this person?\" experience when [lots of criminal charges came out against Bill Cosby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby_sexual_assault_allegations).\n\n* * *\n\n**Example: Gyroscopes**\n\nMost people feel visceral surprise when they watch [how gyroscopes behave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9zhP9Bnx-k#t=1m6s). Even if they *logically know* the suspended gyroscope will rotate instead of falling, they usually *feel* like it's [bizarre](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/hs/think_like_reality/) somehow. Even people who get gyroscopes' behavior into their intuitions probably had to train it for a while first and found them surprising and counterintuitive.\n\nSomehow, for most people, it seems coherent to imagine a world in which physics works exactly the same way *except that* when you suspend one end of a gyroscope, it falls like a non-spinning object would and just keeps spinning.\n\nIf this is true of you, that means your model of the physics around gyroscopes does poorly on test #2 of how Gears-like it is.\n\nThe *reason* gyroscopes do what they do is actually something you can derive from Newton's Laws of Motion. Like the gears example, you can't actually have a coherent model of rotation that allows (a) Newton's Laws and (b) a gyroscope that *doesn't* rotate instead of falling when suspended on one end in a gravitational field. So if both (a) and (b) seem plausible to you, then your model of rotation isn't coherent. It's missing Gears.\n\nThis is one of the beautiful (to me) things about physics: *everything* is made of Gears. Physics is (I think) the system of Gears you get when you stare at any physical object's behavior and ask \"What makes you do that?\" in a Gears-seeking kind of way. It's a different level of abstraction than the \"Gears of people\" thing, but we kind of expect that *eventually*, at least in theory, a sufficient extension of physics will connect the Gears of mechanics to the Gears of what makes a romantic relationship last while feeling good to be in.\n\nI want to rush to clarify that I'm *not* saying that *the world* is made of Gears. That's a type error. I'm suggesting that *the property of Gears-ness in models* is tracking a true thing about the world, which is why making models more Gears-like can be so powerful.\n\n* * *\n\n**Gears-ness is not the same as goodness**\n\nI want to emphasize that, while I think that more Gears are better all else being equal, there are other properties of models that I think are worthwhile.\n\nThe obvious one is accuracy. I've been intentionally sidestepping that property throughout most of this post. This is where the rationalist virtue of empiricism becomes critical, and I've basically ignored (but hopefully never defied!) empiricism here.\n\nAnother is *generativity*. Does the model *inspire a way of experiencing* in ways that are useful (whatever \"useful\" means)? For instance, many beliefs in God or the divine or similar are too abstract to [pay rent](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/), but some people still find them helpful for reframing how they emotionally experience beauty, meaning, and other people. I know of a few ex-atheists who say that having *become* Christian causes them to be nicer people and has made their relationships better. I think there's reason for epistemic fear here to the extent that those religious frameworks [sneak in claims](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey) about how the world actually works — but if you're epistemically careful, it seems possibly worthwhile to explore how to tap the power of faith without taking epistemic damage.\n\nI also think that even if you're trying to lean on the Gears-like power of a model, lacking Gears doesn't mean that the activity is worthless. In fact, I think this is *all we can do* most of the time, because most of our models don't connect all the way down to physics. E.g., I'm thinking of getting my mother a particular book as a gift because I think she'll really like it, but I can *also* come up with a within-my-model-of-her story about why she might *not* really care about it. I don't think the fact that my model of her is weakly constrained means that (a) I shouldn't use the model or that (b) it's not worthwhile to explore the \"why\" behind both my being right and my being wrong. (I think of it as a bit of pre-computation: whichever way the world goes, my model becomes a little more \"crisp\", which is to say, more Gears-like. It just so happens that I know *in what way* beforehand.)\n\nI mention this because sometimes in rationalist contexts, I've felt a pressure to *not talk about* models that are missing Gears. I don't like that. I think that Gears-ness is a *really super important* thing to track, and I think there's something epistemically dangerous about *failing to notice* a lack of Gears. Clearly noting, at least in your own mind, where there are and aren't Gears seems really good to me. But I think there are *other* capacities that are *also* important when we're trying to get epistemology right.\n\nGears seem valuable to me *for a reason*. I'd like us to keep that reason in mind rather than [getting too fixated on Gears-ness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).\n\n* * *\n\n**Going forward**\n\nI think this frame of Gears-ness of models is super powerful for cutting through confusion. It helps our understanding of the world become immune to social foolishness and demands a kind of rigor to our thinking that I see as unifying lots of ideas in the Sequences.\n\nI'll want to build on this frame as I highlight other ideas. In particular, I haven't spoken to *how we know Gears are worth looking for*. So while I view this as a powerful weapon to use in our war against [sanity drought](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/), I think it's *also* important to examine the smithy in which it was forged. I suspect that won't be my *very next* post, but it's one I have in mind upcoming."

It is not the same thing as intelligence, because even those with high intelligence fall prey to some thinking errors as often as everyone else.<sup>5</sup> But then, what <em>is</em> rationality?</p>\n<p><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sherlock-holmes1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"353\" height=\"276\">Cognitive scientists recognize two kinds of rationality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Epistemic rationality</strong> is about forming true beliefs, about getting the <em>map in your head</em> to accurately reflect the <em>territory of the world</em>. We can measure epistemic rationality by comparing the rules of logic and probability theory to the way that a person <em>actually</em> updates their beliefs.</li>\n<li><strong>Instrumental rationality</strong> is about making decisions that are well-aimed at bringing about what you want. Due to habit and bias, many of our decisions don't actually align with our goals. We can measure instrumental rationality with a variety of techniques developed in economics, for example testing whether a person obeys the 'axioms of choice'.<sup>6</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, rationality improves our choices concerning what to believe and what to do.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, human <em>ir</em>rationality is quite common, as shown in popular books like <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kluge-Haphazard-Evolution-Human-Mind/dp/B002ECETZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\">Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Ever since Aristotle spoke of humans as the \"rational animal,\" we've had a picture of ourselves as rational beings that are hampered by shortcomings like anger and fear and confirmation bias.</p>\n<p>Cognitive science says just the opposite. Cognitive science shows us that humans just <em>are</em>&nbsp;a collection of messy little modules like anger and fear and the modules that produce confirmation bias. We have a <em>few</em> modules for processing logic and probability and rational goal-pursuit, but they are slow and energy-expensive and rarely used.</p>\n<p>As we'll see, our brains avoid using these expensive modules whenever possible. Pete Richerson and Robert Boyd explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with.<sup>7</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or, as philosopher David Hull put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage [rational thought] only when all else fails — and usually not even then.<sup>8</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Human_reasoning\"><a name=\"HumanReasoning\"></a>Human reasoning</h4>\n<p>So how does human reasoning work, and why does it so often produce mistaken judgments and decisions?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321928423&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=lesswrong-20\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thinking-fast-and-slow1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"269\" height=\"400\"></a>Today, cognitive scientists talk about <a href=\"/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/\">two kinds</a> of processes, what Daniel Kahneman (2011) calls \"fast and slow\" processes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type 1 processes</strong> are fast, do not require conscious attention, do not need input from conscious processes, and can operate in parallel.</li>\n<li><strong>Type 2 processes</strong> are slow, require conscious effort, and generally only work one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Type 1 processes provide judgments quickly, but these judgments are often wrong, and can be overridden by corrective Type 2 processes.</p>\n<p>Type 2 processes are computationally expensive, and thus humans are '<a href=\"/lw/2ey/a_taxonomy_of_bias_the_cognitive_miser/\">cognitive misers</a>'. This means that we (1) default to Type 1 processes whenever possible, and (2) when we <em>must</em> use Type 2 processes, we use the least expensive kinds of Type 2 processes, those with a 'focal bias' — a disposition to reason from the <em>simplest</em> model available instead of considering all the relevant factors. Hence, we are subject to confirmation bias (our cognition is focused on what we already believe) and other biases.</p>\n<p>So, cognitive miserliness can cause three types of thinking errors:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We default to Type 1 processes when Type 2 processes are needed.</li>\n<li>We fail to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes.</li>\n<li>Even when we override with Type 2 processes, we use Type 2 processes with focal bias.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But the problem gets worse. If someone is going to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes, then she also needs the right <em>content</em>&nbsp;available with which to do the overriding. For example, she may need to override a biased intuitive judgment with a correct application of probability theory, or a correct application of deductive logic. Such tools are called '<a href=\"/lw/2fj/a_taxonomy_of_bias_mindware_problems/\">mindware</a>'.<sup>9</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, thinking can also go wrong if there is a 'mindware gap' — that is, if an agent lacks crucial mindware like probability theory.</p>\n<p>Finally, thinking can go wrong due to 'contaminated mindware'&nbsp;— mindware that exists but is <em>wrong</em>. For example, an agent may have the naive belief that they know their own minds quite well, which is <a href=\"/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/\">false</a>. Such mistaken mindware can lead to mistaken judgments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 id=\"Types_of_errors\">Types of errors</h4>\n<p>Given this understanding, a taxonomy of thinking errors could begin like this:<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/errors-taxonomy-beginning.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>The circles on the left capture the three normal sources of thinking errors. The three rectangles to the right of 'Cognitive Miserliness' capture the three categories of error that can be caused by cognitive miserliness. The <em>rounded</em>&nbsp;rectangles to the right of 'Mindware Gap' and 'Corrupted Mindware' propose some <em>examples</em>&nbsp;of (1) mindware that, if missing, can cause a mindware gap, and (2) common contaminated mindware.</p>\n<p>The process for solving a reasoning task, then, may look something like this:<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Type-1-and-Type-2-process-determination.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\"></p>\n<p>First, do I have mindware available to solve the reasoning problem before me with slow, deliberate, Type 2 processes? If not, my brain must use fast but inaccurate Type 1 processes to solve the problem. If I do have mindware available to solve this problem, do I notice the need to engage it? If not, my brain defaults to the cheaper Type 1 processes. If I <em>do</em>&nbsp;notice the need to engage Type 2 processes and have the necessary mindware, is <em>sustained</em>&nbsp;(as opposed to momentary) 'Type 2 override' required to solve the problem? If not, then I use that mindware to solve the problem. If sustained override <em>is</em>&nbsp;required to solve the reasoning problem and I don't have the cognitive capacity (e.g. working memory) needed to complete the override, then my brain will default back to Type 1 processes. Otherwise, I'll use my cognitive capacities to sustain Type 2 override well enough to complete the reasoning task with my Type 2 processes (mindware).</p>\n<p>That may be something like how our brains determine how to solve a reasoning task.</p>\n<p>It's this model that Stanovich and colleagues (2010) use to explain why, among other things, <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tasks-that-do-and-do-not-correlate-with-cognitive-ability.pdf\">IQ is correlated with performance on some reasoning tasks but not others</a>. For example, IQ correlates with performance on tests of outcome bias and hindsight bias, but not with performance on tests of anchoring effects and omission bias. To overcome these latter biases, subjects seem to need not just high cognitive capacity (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence\">fluid intelligence</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory\">working memory</a>, etc.), but also specific rationality training.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/reflective-algorithmic-autonomous.png\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\">If this is right, then we may talk of three different 'minds' at work in solving reasoning problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>autonomous</em>&nbsp;mind, made of unconscious Type 1 processes.

We also must find ways to meliorate the problem if we want to have more accurate beliefs and more efficiently achieve our goals. As Milkman et al. (2010) say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the time has come to move the study of biases in judgment and&nbsp;decision making beyond description and toward the development of improvement&nbsp;strategies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stanovich (2009) sums up our project:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To jointly achieve epistemic and instrumental rationality, a person must display judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal prioritization, sufficient thoughtfulness, and proper evidence calibration. For example, epistemic rationality — beliefs that are properly matched to the world — requires&nbsp;probabilistic reasoning and the ability to calibrate theories to evidence. Instrumental rationality — maximizing goal fulfillment — requires adherence to all of the axioms of rational choice. People fail to fulfill the many different strictures of rational thought because they are cognitive misers, because they lack critical mindware, and because they have acquired contaminated mindware. These errors can be prevented by acquiring the mindware of rational thought and the thinking dispositions that prevent the overuse of the strategies of the cognitive miser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the project of 'debiasing' ourselves<sup>14</sup> with 'ameliorative psychology'.<sup>15</sup></p>\n<p>What we want is a <strong>Rationality Toolkit</strong>: a set of skills and techniques that can be used to overcome and correct the errors of our primate brains so we can form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.</p>\n<p>Our goal is not unlike Carl Sagan's '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU\">Baloney Detection Kit</a>', but the tools in our Rationality Toolkit will be more specific and better grounded in the cognitive science of rationality.</p>\n<p>I mentioned some examples of debiasing interventions that have been tested by experimental psychologists in my post <a href=\"/lw/76x/is_rationality_teachable/\">Is Rationality Teachable?</a>&nbsp;I'll start with those, then add a few techniques for ameliorating the <a href=\"/lw/jg/planning_fallacy/\">planning fallacy</a>, and we've got the beginnings of our Rationality Toolkit:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A simple instruction to \"think about alternatives\" can promote resistance to overconfidence and confirmation bias. In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,<sup>19</sup> teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Warning people about biases can decrease their prevalence. So far, this has been demonstrated to work with regard to framing effects,<sup>21</sup> hindsight bias,<sup>22</sup> and the outcome effect,<sup>23</sup> though attempts to mitigate anchoring effects by warning people about them have produced weak results so far.<sup>24</sup></li>\n<li>Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an 'outside view' when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is 'reference class forecasting',<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.</li>\n<li>Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study<sup>27</sup> students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But this is <a href=\"/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/\">only the start</a>.

Because decision makers should consider only the future costs and benefits of the choices before them, sunk costs should be irrelevant to human decisions. Alas, sunk costs regularly do effect human decisions: Knox &amp; Inkster (1968); Arkes &amp; Blumer (1985); Arkes &amp; Ayton (1999); Arkes &amp; Hutzel (2000); Staw (1976); Whyte (1986).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;People are more generous (say, in giving charity) toward a single identifiable victim than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims (Kogut &amp; Ritov 2005a, 2010; Jenni &amp; Loewenstein 1997; Small &amp; Loewenstein 2003; Small et al. 2007; Slovic 2007), even though they say they prefer to give to a group of people (Kogut &amp; Ritov 2005b).</small></p>\n<p><small><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Yudkowsky summarizes <a href=\"/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>:</small></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><small>Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88 [Desvousges et al. 1992]. This is scope insensitivity or scope neglect: the number of birds saved — the scope of the altruistic action — had little effect on willingness to pay.</small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>See also: Kahneman (1986); McFadden &amp; Leonard (1995); Carson &amp; Mitchell (1995); Fetherstonhaugh et al.

(2008) write:</small></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><small>Cognitive scientists recognize two types of rationality: instrumental and epistemic... [We] could characterize instrumental rationality as the optimization of the individual’s goal fulfillment. Economists and cognitive scientists have reﬁned the notion of optimization of goal fulfillment into the technical notion of expected utility. The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility...</small></p>\n<p><small>The other aspect of rationality studied by cognitive scientists is termed epistemic rationality. This aspect of rationality concerns how well beliefs map onto the actual structure of the world. Instrumental and epistemic rationality are related. The aspect of beliefs that enter into instrumental calculations (i.e., tacit calculations) are the probabilities of states of affairs in the world.</small></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><small>Also see the discussion in Stanovich et al. (2011). On instrumental rationality as the maximization of expected utility, see&nbsp;Dawes (1998); Hastie &amp; Dawes (2009);&nbsp;Wu et al. (2004). On epistemic reality, see Foley (1987); Harman (1995); Manktelow (2004); Over (2004).</small></p>\n<p><small>How can we measure an individual's divergence from expected utility maximization if we can't yet measure utility directly? One of the triumphs of decision science is the demonstration that agents whose behavior respects the so-called 'axioms of choice' will behave as if they are maximizing expected utility. It can be difficult to measure utility, but it is easier to measure whether one of the axioms of choice are being violated, and thus whether an agent is behaving instrumentally irrationally.</small></p>\n<p><small>Violations of both instrumental and epistemic rationality have been catalogued at length by cognitive psychologists in the 'heuristics and biases' literature: Baron (2007); Evans (1989, 2007); Gilovich et al. (2002);&nbsp;Kahneman &amp; Tversky (2000); Shaﬁr &amp; LeBoeuf (2002); Stanovich (1999).

Regular Less Wrong readers may want to jump to the [Stanovich material](#HumanReasoning).)\n\n![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Flammarion-Engraving.jpg)\n\nThe last 40 years of cognitive science have taught us a great deal about how our brains produce errors in thinking and decision making, and about how we can overcome those errors. These methods can help us form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.\n\nLong before the first Concorde supersonic jet was completed, the British and French governments developing it realized it would lose money. But they continued to develop the jet when they should have cut their losses, because they felt they had \"invested too much to quit\"^1^ (sunk cost fallacy^2^).\n\nJohn tested positive for an extremely rare but fatal disease, using a test that is accurate 80% of the time. John didn't have health insurance, and the only available treatment — which his doctor recommended — was very expensive. John agreed to the treatment, his retirement fund was drained to nothing, and during the treatment it was discovered that John did _not_ have the rare disease after all. Later, a statistician explained to John that because the disease is so rare, the chance that he had had the disease even _given_ the positive test was less than one in a million. But neither John's brain nor his doctor's brain had computed this correctly ([base rate neglect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)).\n\nMary gave money to a charity to save lives in the developing world. Unfortunately, she gave to a charity that saves lives at a cost of $100,000 per life instead of one that saves lives at 1/10th that cost, because the less efficient charity used a vivid picture of a starving child on its advertising, and our brains respond more to single, identifiable victims than to large numbers of victims (identifiability effect^3^ and scope insensitivity^4^).\n\nDuring the last four decades, cognitive scientists have discovered a long list of [common thinking errors](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Bias) like these. These errors lead us to false beliefs and poor decisions.\n\nHow are these errors produced, and how can we overcome them? Vague advice like \"be skeptical\" and \"think critically\" may not help much. Luckily, cognitive scientists know a great deal about the mathematics of _correct_ thinking, how thinking errors are _produced_, and how we can _overcome_ these errors in order to live more fulfilling lives.\n\n#### Rationality\n\nFirst, what is [rationality](/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality/)? It is not the same thing as intelligence, because even those with high intelligence fall prey to some thinking errors as often as everyone else.^5^ But then, what _is_ rationality?\n\n![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/sherlock-holmes1.jpg)Cognitive scientists recognize two kinds of rationality:\n\n*   **Epistemic rationality** is about forming true beliefs, about getting the _map in your head_ to accurately reflect the _territory of the world_. We can measure epistemic rationality by comparing the rules of logic and probability theory to the way that a person _actually_ updates their beliefs.\n*   **Instrumental rationality** is about making decisions that are well-aimed at bringing about what you want. Due to habit and bias, many of our decisions don't actually align with our goals. We can measure instrumental rationality with a variety of techniques developed in economics, for example testing whether a person obeys the 'axioms of choice'.^6^\n\nIn short, rationality improves our choices concerning what to believe and what to do.\n\nUnfortunately, human _ir_rationality is quite common, as shown in popular books like _[Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions](http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Revised-Expanded-Decisions/dp/0061353248/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321928423&linkCode=as2&tag=lesswrong-20)_ and _[Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Kluge-Haphazard-Evolution-Human-Mind/dp/B002ECETZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321928423&linkCode=as2&tag=lesswrong-20)_.\n\nEver since Aristotle spoke of humans as the \"rational animal,\" we've had a picture of ourselves as rational beings that are hampered by shortcomings like anger and fear and confirmation bias.\n\nCognitive science says just the opposite. Cognitive science shows us that humans just _are_ a collection of messy little modules like anger and fear and the modules that produce confirmation bias. We have a _few_ modules for processing logic and probability and rational goal-pursuit, but they are slow and energy-expensive and rarely used.\n\nAs we'll see, our brains avoid using these expensive modules whenever possible. Pete Richerson and Robert Boyd explain:\n\n> ...all animals are under stringent selection pressure to be as stupid as they can get away with.^7^\n\nOr, as philosopher David Hull put it:\n\n> The rule that human beings seem to follow is to engage \\[rational thought\\] only when all else fails — and usually not even then.^8^\n\n#### Human reasoning\n\nSo how does human reasoning work, and why does it so often produce mistaken judgments and decisions?\n\n[![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/thinking-fast-and-slow1.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374275637/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321928423&linkCode=as2&tag=lesswrong-20)Today, cognitive scientists talk about [two kinds](/lw/531/how_you_make_judgments_the_elephant_and_its_rider/) of processes, what Daniel Kahneman (2011) calls \"fast and slow\" processes:\n\n*   **Type 1 processes** are fast, do not require conscious attention, do not need input from conscious processes, and can operate in parallel.\n*   **Type 2 processes** are slow, require conscious effort, and generally only work one at a time.\n\nType 1 processes provide judgments quickly, but these judgments are often wrong, and can be overridden by corrective Type 2 processes.\n\nType 2 processes are computationally expensive, and thus humans are '[cognitive misers](/lw/2ey/a_taxonomy_of_bias_the_cognitive_miser/)'. This means that we (1) default to Type 1 processes whenever possible, and (2) when we _must_ use Type 2 processes, we use the least expensive kinds of Type 2 processes, those with a 'focal bias' — a disposition to reason from the _simplest_ model available instead of considering all the relevant factors. Hence, we are subject to confirmation bias (our cognition is focused on what we already believe) and other biases.\n\nSo, cognitive miserliness can cause three types of thinking errors:\n\n1.  We default to Type 1 processes when Type 2 processes are needed.\n2.  We fail to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes.\n3.  Even when we override with Type 2 processes, we use Type 2 processes with focal bias.\n\nBut the problem gets worse. If someone is going to override Type 1 processes with Type 2 processes, then she also needs the right _content_ available with which to do the overriding. For example, she may need to override a biased intuitive judgment with a correct application of probability theory, or a correct application of deductive logic. Such tools are called '[mindware](/lw/2fj/a_taxonomy_of_bias_mindware_problems/)'.^9^\n\nThus, thinking can also go wrong if there is a 'mindware gap' — that is, if an agent lacks crucial mindware like probability theory.\n\nFinally, thinking can go wrong due to 'contaminated mindware' — mindware that exists but is _wrong_. For example, an agent may have the naive belief that they know their own minds quite well, which is [false](/lw/5sk/inferring_our_desires/). Such mistaken mindware can lead to mistaken judgments.\n\n#### Types of errors\n\nGiven this understanding, a taxonomy of thinking errors could begin like this:^10^\n\n![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/errors-taxonomy-beginning.png)\n\nThe circles on the left capture the three normal sources of thinking errors. The three rectangles to the right of 'Cognitive Miserliness' capture the three categories of error that can be caused by cognitive miserliness. The _rounded_ rectangles to the right of 'Mindware Gap' and 'Corrupted Mindware' propose some _examples_ of (1) mindware that, if missing, can cause a mindware gap, and (2) common contaminated mindware.\n\nThe process for solving a reasoning task, then, may look something like this:^11^\n\n![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Type-1-and-Type-2-process-determination.png)\n\nFirst, do I have mindware available to solve the reasoning problem before me with slow, deliberate, Type 2 processes? If not, my brain must use fast but inaccurate Type 1 processes to solve the problem. If I do have mindware available to solve this problem, do I notice the need to engage it? If not, my brain defaults to the cheaper Type 1 processes. If I _do_ notice the need to engage Type 2 processes and have the necessary mindware, is _sustained_ (as opposed to momentary) 'Type 2 override' required to solve the problem? If not, then I use that mindware to solve the problem. If sustained override _is_ required to solve the reasoning problem and I don't have the cognitive capacity (e.g. working memory) needed to complete the override, then my brain will default back to Type 1 processes. Otherwise, I'll use my cognitive capacities to sustain Type 2 override well enough to complete the reasoning task with my Type 2 processes (mindware).\n\nThat may be something like how our brains determine how to solve a reasoning task.\n\nIt's this model that Stanovich and colleagues (2010) use to explain why, among other things, [IQ is correlated with performance on some reasoning tasks but not others](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Tasks-that-do-and-do-not-correlate-with-cognitive-ability.pdf). For example, IQ correlates with performance on tests of outcome bias and hindsight bias, but not with performance on tests of anchoring effects and omission bias. To overcome these latter biases, subjects seem to need not just high cognitive capacity ([fluid intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_and_crystallized_intelligence), [working memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), etc.), but also specific rationality training.\n\n![](http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/reflective-algorithmic-autonomous.png)If this is right, then we may talk of three different 'minds' at work in solving reasoning problems:\n\n*   The _autonomous_ mind, made of unconscious Type 1 processes. There are few individual differences in its operation.\n*   The _algorithmic_ mind, made of conscious Type 2 processes. There are significant individual differences in fluid intelligence in particular and cognitive capacity in general — that is, differences in perceptual speed, discrimination accuracy, working memory capacity, and the efficiency of the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory.^12^\n*   The _reflective mind_, which shows individual differences in the disposition to use rationality mindware — the disposition to generate alternative hypotheses, to use fully disjunctive reasoning, to engage in actively open-minded thinking, etc.^13^\n\n#### Rationality Skills\n\nBut it is not enough to understand how the human brain produces thinking errors. We also must find ways to meliorate the problem if we want to have more accurate beliefs and more efficiently achieve our goals. As Milkman et al. (2010) say:\n\n> ...the time has come to move the study of biases in judgment and decision making beyond description and toward the development of improvement strategies.\n\nStanovich (2009) sums up our project:\n\n> To jointly achieve epistemic and instrumental rationality, a person must display judicious decision making, adequate behavioral regulation, wise goal prioritization, sufficient thoughtfulness, and proper evidence calibration. For example, epistemic rationality — beliefs that are properly matched to the world — requires probabilistic reasoning and the ability to calibrate theories to evidence. Instrumental rationality — maximizing goal fulfillment — requires adherence to all of the axioms of rational choice. People fail to fulfill the many different strictures of rational thought because they are cognitive misers, because they lack critical mindware, and because they have acquired contaminated mindware. These errors can be prevented by acquiring the mindware of rational thought and the thinking dispositions that prevent the overuse of the strategies of the cognitive miser.\n\nThis is the project of 'debiasing' ourselves^14^ with 'ameliorative psychology'.^15^\n\nWhat we want is a **Rationality Toolkit**: a set of skills and techniques that can be used to overcome and correct the errors of our primate brains so we can form more accurate beliefs and make better decisions.\n\nOur goal is not unlike Carl Sagan's '[Baloney Detection Kit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU)', but the tools in our Rationality Toolkit will be more specific and better grounded in the cognitive science of rationality.\n\nI mentioned some examples of debiasing interventions that have been tested by experimental psychologists in my post [Is Rationality Teachable?](/lw/76x/is_rationality_teachable/) I'll start with those, then add a few techniques for ameliorating the [planning fallacy](/lw/jg/planning_fallacy/), and we've got the beginnings of our Rationality Toolkit:\n\n1.  A simple instruction to \"think about alternatives\" can promote resistance to overconfidence and confirmation bias. In one study, subjects asked to generate their own hypotheses are more responsive to their accuracy than subjects asked to choose from among pre-picked hypotheses.^16^ Another study required subjects to list reasons for and against each of the possible answers to each question on a quiz prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This process resulted in more accurate confidence judgments relative to a control group.^17^ \n2.  Training in microeconomics can help subjects avoid the sunk cost fallacy.^18^ \n3.  Because people avoid the base rate fallacy more often when they encounter problems phrased in terms of frequencies instead of probabilities,^19^ teaching people to translate probabilistic reasoning tasks into frequency formats improves their performance.^20^ \n4.  Warning people about biases can decrease their prevalence. So far, this has been demonstrated to work with regard to framing effects,^21^ hindsight bias,^22^ and the outcome effect,^23^ though attempts to mitigate anchoring effects by warning people about them have produced weak results so far.^24^\n5.  Research on the planning fallacy suggests that taking an 'outside view' when predicting the time and resources required to complete a task will lead to better predictions. A specific instance of this strategy is 'reference class forecasting',^25^ in which planners project time and resource costs for a project by basing their projections on the outcomes of a distribution of comparable projects.\n6.  Unpacking the components involved in a large task or project helps people to see more clearly how much time and how many resources will be required to complete it, thereby partially meliorating the planning fallacy.^26^ \n7.  One reason we fall prey to the planning fallacy is that we do not remain as focused on the task at hand throughout its execution as when we are planning its execution. The planning fallacy can be partially meliorated, then, not only by improving the planning but by improving the execution. For example, in one study^27^ students were taught to imagine themselves performing each of the steps needed to complete a project. Participants rehearsed these simulations each day. 41% of these students completed their tasks on time, compared to 14% in a control group.\n\nBut this is [only the start](/lw/5x8/teachable_rationality_skills/). We need more rationality skills, and we need step-by-step instructions for how to teach them and how to implement them at the [5-second level](/lw/5kz/the_5second_level/).\n\n#### Notes\n\n^1^ Teger (1980).\n\n^2^ A sunk cost is a cost from the past that cannot be recovered. Because decision makers should consider only the future costs and benefits of the choices before them, sunk costs should be irrelevant to human decisions. Alas, sunk costs regularly do effect human decisions: Knox & Inkster (1968); Arkes & Blumer (1985); Arkes & Ayton (1999); Arkes & Hutzel (2000); Staw (1976); Whyte (1986).\n\n^3^ People are more generous (say, in giving charity) toward a single identifiable victim than toward unidentifiable or statistical victims (Kogut & Ritov 2005a, 2010; Jenni & Loewenstein 1997; Small & Loewenstein 2003; Small et al. 2007; Slovic 2007), even though they say they prefer to give to a group of people (Kogut & Ritov 2005b).\n\n^4^ Yudkowsky summarizes [scope insensitivity](/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/):\n\n> Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88 \\[Desvousges et al. 1992\\]. This is scope insensitivity or scope neglect: the number of birds saved — the scope of the altruistic action — had little effect on willingness to pay.\n\nSee also: Kahneman (1986); McFadden & Leonard (1995); Carson & Mitchell (1995); Fetherstonhaugh et al. (1997); Slovic et al. (2011).\n\n^5^ Stanovich & West (2008); Ross et al. (1977); Krueger (2000).\n\n^6^ Stanovich et al. (2008) write:\n\n> Cognitive scientists recognize two types of rationality: instrumental and epistemic... \\[We\\] could characterize instrumental rationality as the optimization of the individual’s goal fulfillment. Economists and cognitive scientists have reﬁned the notion of optimization of goal fulfillment into the technical notion of expected utility. The model of rational judgment used by decision scientists is one in which a person chooses options based on which option has the largest expected utility...\n> \n> The other aspect of rationality studied by cognitive scientists is termed epistemic rationality. This aspect of rationality concerns how well beliefs map onto the actual structure of the world. Instrumental and epistemic rationality are related. The aspect of beliefs that enter into instrumental calculations (i.e., tacit calculations) are the probabilities of states of affairs in the world.\n\nAlso see the discussion in Stanovich et al. (2011). On instrumental rationality as the maximization of expected utility, see Dawes (1998); Hastie & Dawes (2009); Wu et al. (2004). On epistemic reality, see Foley (1987); Harman (1995); Manktelow (2004); Over (2004).\n\nHow can we measure an individual's divergence from expected utility maximization if we can't yet measure utility directly? One of the triumphs of decision science is the demonstration that agents whose behavior respects the so-called 'axioms of choice' will behave as if they are maximizing expected utility. It can be difficult to measure utility, but it is easier to measure whether one of the axioms of choice are being violated, and thus whether an agent is behaving instrumentally irrationally.\n\nViolations of both instrumental and epistemic rationality have been catalogued at length by cognitive psychologists in the 'heuristics and biases' literature: Baron (2007); Evans (1989, 2007); Gilovich et al. (2002); Kahneman & Tversky (2000); Shaﬁr & LeBoeuf (2002); Stanovich (1999).

Here's the biggest one.</p><h1 id=\"A_rationalist__in_the_sense_of_this_particular_community__is_someone_who_is_trying_to_build_and_update_a_unified_probabilistic_model_of_how_the_entire_world_works__and_trying_to_use_that_model_to_make_predictions_and_decisions_\">A rationalist, in the sense of this particular community, is someone who is trying to build and update a unified probabilistic model of how the entire world works, and trying to use that model to make predictions and decisions.</h1><p>By \"unified\" I mean <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N2pENnTPB75sfc9kb/outside-the-laboratory\">decompartmentalized</a>- if there's a domain where the model gives two incompatible predictions, then as soon as that's noticed it has to be rectified in some way.</p><p>And it's important that it be probabilistic- it's perfectly consistent to resolve a conflict between predictions by saying \"I currently think the answer is X with about 60% probability, and Y with about 25% probability, and with about 15% probability I'm missing the correct option or confused about the nature of the question entirely\".</p><p>The Sequences are aimed at people trying to do exactly this thing, and Eliezer focuses on how to not go horribly wrong in the process (with a special focus on not trusting one's own sense of obviousness).</p><p>Being a rationalist isn't about any specific set of conclusions- it's not about being an effective altruist, or a utilitarian, or even an atheist. It's about whether one is trying to <em>do that thing</em> or not. Even if one is doing a terrible job of it!</p><p>Truth-seeking is a prerequisite, but it's not enough. It's possible to be very disciplined about finding and assembling true facts, without thereby changing the way one thinks about the world. As a contrast, here's how the New York Times, whose fact-checking quality is not in dispute, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/11/shocked-by-trump-new-york-times-finds-time-for-soul-searching-1201852490/\">decides what to report:</a></p><blockquote>By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called “the narrative.” We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line.</blockquote><p>The difference between wielding a narrative and fitting new facts into it, and learning a model from new facts, is the difference <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SFZoEBpLo9frSJGkc/rationalization\">between rationalization and rationality</a>.</p><p>\"Taking weird ideas seriously\" is also a prerequisite (because some weird ideas are true, and if you bounce off of them you won't get far), but again it's not enough. I shouldn't really need to convince you of that one.</p><p>Okay, then, so what's a post-rationalist?</p><p>The people who identify as such generally don't want to pin it down, but here's my attempt at categorizing at least the ones who make sense to me:</p><h1 id=\"A_post_rationalist_is_someone_who_believes_the_rationalist_project_is_misguided_or_impossible__but_who_likes_to_use_some_of_the_tools_and_concepts_developed_by_the_rationalists_\">A post-rationalist is someone who believes the rationalist project is misguided or impossible, but who likes to use some of the tools and concepts developed by the rationalists.</h1><p>Of course I'm less confident that this properly defines the cluster, outside of groups like Ribbonfarm where it seems to fit quite well. There are people who view the Sequences (or whatever parts have diffused to them) the way they view Derrida: as one more tool to try on an interesting conundrum, see if it works there, but not really treat it as applicable across the board.</p><p>And there are those who talk about being a fox rather than a hedgehog (and therefore see trying to reconcile one's models across domains as being harmful), and those who talk about how the very attempt is a matter of hubris, that not only can we not know the universe, we cannot even realistically aspire to decent calibration.</p><p>And then, of course:</p><h1 id=\"A_rationalist_adjacent_is_someone_who_enjoys_spending_time_with_some_clusters_of_rationalists__and_or_enjoys_discussing_some_topics_with_rationalists___but_who_is_not_interested_in_doing_the_whole_rationalist_thing_themself_\">A rationalist-adjacent is someone who enjoys spending time with some clusters of rationalists (and/or enjoys discussing some topics with rationalists), but who is not interested in doing the whole rationalist thing themself.</h1><p>Which is not a bad thing at all! It's honestly a good sign of a healthy community that the community appeals even to people for whom the project doesn't appeal, and the rationalist-adjacents may be more psychologically healthy than the rationalists.</p><p>The real issue of contention, as far as I'm concerned, is something I've saved for the end: <strong>that not everyone who self-identifies as a rationalist fits the first definition very well, and that the first definition is in fact a more compact cluster than self-identification.</strong></p><p>And that makes this community, and this site, a bit tricky to navigate. There are rationalist-adjacents for whom a double-crux on many topics would fail because they're not interested in zooming in so close on a belief. There are post-rationalists for whom a double-crux would fail because they can just switch frames on the conversation any time they're feeling stuck. And to try to double-crux with someone, only to have it fail in either of those ways, is an infuriating feeling for those of us who thought we could take it for granted in the community.</p><p>I don't yet know of an intervention for signaling that a conversation is happening on explicitly rationalist norms- it's hard to do that in a way that others won't feel pressured to insist they'd follow. But I wish there were one.</p>",

Here's the biggest one.\n\nA rationalist, in the sense of this particular community, is someone who is trying to build and update a unified probabilistic model of how the entire world works, and trying to use that model to make predictions and decisions.\n===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nBy \"unified\" I mean [decompartmentalized](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N2pENnTPB75sfc9kb/outside-the-laboratory)\\- if there's a domain where the model gives two incompatible predictions, then as soon as that's noticed it has to be rectified in some way.\n\nAnd it's important that it be probabilistic- it's perfectly consistent to resolve a conflict between predictions by saying \"I currently think the answer is X with about 60% probability, and Y with about 25% probability, and with about 15% probability I'm missing the correct option or confused about the nature of the question entirely\".\n\nThe Sequences are aimed at people trying to do exactly this thing, and Eliezer focuses on how to not go horribly wrong in the process (with a special focus on not trusting one's own sense of obviousness).\n\nBeing a rationalist isn't about any specific set of conclusions- it's not about being an effective altruist, or a utilitarian, or even an atheist. It's about whether one is trying to _do that thing_ or not. Even if one is doing a terrible job of it!\n\nTruth-seeking is a prerequisite, but it's not enough. It's possible to be very disciplined about finding and assembling true facts, without thereby changing the way one thinks about the world. As a contrast, here's how the New York Times, whose fact-checking quality is not in dispute, [decides what to report:](https://deadline.com/2016/11/shocked-by-trump-new-york-times-finds-time-for-soul-searching-1201852490/)\n\n> By and large, talented reporters scrambled to match stories with what internally was often called “the narrative.” We were occasionally asked to map a narrative for our various beats a year in advance, square the plan with editors, then generate stories that fit the pre-designated line.\n\nThe difference between wielding a narrative and fitting new facts into it, and learning a model from new facts, is the difference [between rationalization and rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SFZoEBpLo9frSJGkc/rationalization).\n\n\"Taking weird ideas seriously\" is also a prerequisite (because some weird ideas are true, and if you bounce off of them you won't get far), but again it's not enough. I shouldn't really need to convince you of that one.\n\nOkay, then, so what's a post-rationalist?\n\nThe people who identify as such generally don't want to pin it down, but here's my attempt at categorizing at least the ones who make sense to me:\n\nA post-rationalist is someone who believes the rationalist project is misguided or impossible, but who likes to use some of the tools and concepts developed by the rationalists.\n=================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nOf course I'm less confident that this properly defines the cluster, outside of groups like Ribbonfarm where it seems to fit quite well. There are people who view the Sequences (or whatever parts have diffused to them) the way they view Derrida: as one more tool to try on an interesting conundrum, see if it works there, but not really treat it as applicable across the board.\n\nAnd there are those who talk about being a fox rather than a hedgehog (and therefore see trying to reconcile one's models across domains as being harmful), and those who talk about how the very attempt is a matter of hubris, that not only can we not know the universe, we cannot even realistically aspire to decent calibration.\n\nAnd then, of course:\n\nA rationalist-adjacent is someone who enjoys spending time with some clusters of rationalists (and/or enjoys discussing some topics with rationalists), but who is not interested in doing the whole rationalist thing themself.\n================================================================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nWhich is not a bad thing at all! It's honestly a good sign of a healthy community that the community appeals even to people for whom the project doesn't appeal, and the rationalist-adjacents may be more psychologically healthy than the rationalists.\n\nThe real issue of contention, as far as I'm concerned, is something I've saved for the end: **that not everyone who self-identifies as a rationalist fits the first definition very well, and that the first definition is in fact a more compact cluster than self-identification.**\n\nAnd that makes this community, and this site, a bit tricky to navigate. There are rationalist-adjacents for whom a double-crux on many topics would fail because they're not interested in zooming in so close on a belief. There are post-rationalists for whom a double-crux would fail because they can just switch frames on the conversation any time they're feeling stuck. And to try to double-crux with someone, only to have it fail in either of those ways, is an infuriating feeling for those of us who thought we could take it for granted in the community.\n\nI don't yet know of an intervention for signaling that a conversation is happening on explicitly rationalist norms- it's hard to do that in a way that others won't feel pressured to insist they'd follow. But I wish there were one."

Participants feel encouraged by expert advice and support, and research begins on the improved research proposal.</p><p>Researchers begin formalising and coding up these approaches, sharing their work in a Github repository that they can use as evidence of their engineering ability. It becomes clear that a new gridworld is needed to investigate issues arising from research so far. After a brief conversation, their advisor is able to put them in touch with the relevant engineer at Deepmind, who gives them some useful tips on creating this.</p><p>At the research camp the participants are able to discuss their findings and put them in context, as well as solve some technical issues that were impossible to resolve part-time and remotely. They write up their findings into a draft paper and present it at the end of the camp. The paper is read and commented on by advisors, who give suggestions on how to improve the paper’s clarity. The paper is submitted to NIPS 2018’s Aligned AI workshop and is accepted.</p><p><strong>Expected outcome: </strong>Each research group will aim to produce results that can form the kernel of a paper at the end of the July camp. We don’t expect every group to achieve this, as research progress is hard to predict.</p><ol><li>At the end of the camp, from five groups, we would expect three to have initial results and a first draft of a paper that the expert advisors find promising.</li><li>Within six months following the camp, three or more draft papers have been written that are considered to be promising by the research community.</li><li>Within one year following the camp, three or more researchers who participated in the project obtain funding or research roles in AI safety or strategy.</li></ol><p><strong>Next steps following the camp:</strong> When teams have produced promising results, camp organizers and expert advisors will endeavour to connect the teams to the right parties to help the research shape up further and be taken to conclusion.</p><p>Possible destinations for participants who wish to remain in research after the camp would likely be some combination of:</p><ol><li>Full-time internships in areas of interest, for instance <u><a href=\"https://deepmind.com/careers/476630/\">Deepmind</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/vacancies/\">FHI</a></u> or <u><a href=\"http://humancompatible.ai/jobs#internship\">CHAI</a></u> </li><li>Full-time research roles at AI safety/strategy organisations</li><li>Obtaining research funding such as <u><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-philanthropy-project-ai-fellows-program\">OpenPhil</a></u> or <u><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/2017/12/20/2018-international-ai-safety-grants-competition/\">FLI</a></u> research grants - successful publications may unlock new sources of funding</li><li>Independent remote research</li><li>Research engineering roles at technical AI safety organisations</li></ol><p>Research projects can be tailored towards participants’ goals - for instance researchers who are interested in engineering or machine learning-related approaches to safety can structure a project to include a significant coding element, leading to (for instance) a GitHub repo that can be used as evidence of engineering skill. This is also a relatively easy way for people who are unsure if research work is for them to try it out without the large time investment and opportunity cost of a PhD or masters program, although we do not see it as a full replacement for these.</p><h3 id=\"Plan\">Plan</h3><p><strong><u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l02CtyQo-sUiXv4RlwRB2DHOXyS6pC7_lGcx0vxOOtY/edit\">Timeline</a></u>: </strong>We anticipate this project having 4 main phases (dates are currently open for discussion):</p><ol><li>Plan and develop the project, recruit researchers and look for advisors - December 2017 to April 2018</li><li>Testing and refinement of event design during a small-scale camp at Gran Canaria - April 12-22</li><li>Project selection, refinement and exploration (online) - April 2018 to July 2018</li><li>Research camp (in person) - July/August 2018</li></ol><p><strong>Recruiting: </strong>We plan to have approximately 20 researchers working in teams of 3-5 people, with projects in agent foundations, machine learning, strategy/policy and human values/cognition. Based on responses to a registration form we have already posted online (link <u><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xj7ffjihLyIqtPPEMozwnHA3HsKhzFD7ZxblVkA1O5g\">here</a></u>) we expect to be able to easily meet this number of participants. </p><p>Each team will be advised by a more experienced researcher in the relevant area, however we expect this won’t be as tightly-coupled a relationship as that between PhD students and their supervisors - the aim is to maximise the usefulness of the relatively scarce advisor time and to develop as much independence in researchers as possible.</p><p><strong>Project selection and exploration: </strong>Once the initial recruitment phase is complete, researchers and advisors can choose a project to work on and refine it into a single question answerable within the timeframe. We recognise the need for strong project planning skills and careful project choice and refinement here, and this project choice is a potential point of failure (see Important Considerations below). Following project selection, researchers will begin exploring the research project they’ve chosen in the months between project choice and the research camp. This would probably require five to ten hours a week of commitment from researchers, mostly asynchronously but with a weekly ‘scrum’ meeting to share progress within a project team. Regular sharing of progress and forward planning will be important to keep momentum going.</p><p><strong>Research camp:</strong> Following the selection and exploration, we will have a two-week intensive camp assembling all participants in-person at a retreat to do focused work on the research projects. Exploratory work can be done asynchronously, but finishing research projects can be hard work and require intensive communication which can more easily be done in person. This also makes the full-time element of this project much more bounded and manageable for most potential participants. An in-person meeting also allows for much better communication between researchers on different projects, as well as helping form lasting and fruitful connections between researchers.</p><h3 id=\"Important_Considerations\">Important Considerations</h3><p><strong>Shaping the research question: </strong>Selecting good research questions for this project will be challenging, and is one of the main potential points of failure. The non-traditional structure of the event brings with it some extra considerations. We expect that most projects will be:</p><ol><li>Tractable to allow progress to be made in a short period of time, rather than conceptually complex or open-ended</li><li>Closely related to current work, e.g. suggestions found in ‘further work’ or ‘open questions’ sections from recent papers</li><li>Parallelisable across multiple researchers, e.g. evaluating multiple possible solutions to a single problem or researching separate aspects of a policy proposal</li></ol><p>This biases project selection towards incremental research, i.e. extending previous work rather than finding completely new approaches. This is hard to avoid in these circumstances, and we are optimising at least partly for the creation of new researchers who can go on to do more risky, less incremental research in the future. Furthermore, a look at the ‘future work/open questions’ sections of many published safety papers will reveal a broad selection of interesting, useful questions that still meet the criteria above so although this is a tradeoff, we do not expect it to be overly limiting. A good example of this in the Machine Learning subfield would be evaluating multiple approaches to one of the problems listed in DeepMind’s recent <u><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883\">AI Safety gridworlds paper</a></u>.</p><p><strong>Finding advisors:  </strong>Although we intend this to be relatively self-contained, some amount of advice from active researchers will be beneficial at both the project selection and research stages, as well as at the end of the camp. The most useful periods for advisor involvement will be at the initial project selection/shaping phase and at the end of the camp - the former allows for better, more tractable projects as well as conveying previously unpublished relevant information and a sense of what’s considered interesting. The latter will be useful for preparing papers and integrating new researchers into the existing community. Informal enquiries suggest that it is likely to be possible to recruit advisors for these stages, but ongoing commitments will be more challenging.</p><p>The expected commitment during project selection and shaping would be one or two sessions of several hours spent evaluating and commenting on proposed research projects. This could be done asynchronously or by video chat. Commitment at the end of the research camp is likely to be similar - responding to initial drafts of papers with suggestions of improvements or further research in a similar way to the peer review process.</p><p><strong>Costs: </strong>The main costs for the Gran Canaria camp, the AirBnBs, meals and low-income travel reimbursements, have been covered now by two funders. The July camp will likely take place in the UK at the <u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624791014242988/?ref=br_rs\">EA Hotel</a></u>, a co-working hub planned by Greg Colbourn (for other options, see <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cX4yrEH4Kw8-CdT9zRhV7EHD1xXLO6T9NqiK5FQ5pKk/edit#gid=0\">here</a></u>). For this, we will publish a funding proposal around April. Please see <u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5W8u8czOp_MEaZtb2iwPmmFs1CFkkH6RuI0NHrfP_I/edit#gid=781421298\">here</a></u> for the draft budgets. </p><h3 id=\"Long_term_and_wider_impacts\">Long-term and wider impacts</h3><p>If the camp proves to be successful, it could serve as the foundation for yearly recurring camps to keep boosting aspiring researchers into productivity. It could become a much-needed additional lever to grow the fields of AI safety and AI strategy for many years to come. The research camp model could also be used to grow AI safety research communities where none presently exist, but there is a strong need - in China, for instance. By using experienced coordinators and advisors in conjunction with local volunteers, it may be possible to organise a research camp without the need for pre-existing experts in the community. A camp provides a coordination point for interested participants, signals support for community building, and if previous camps have been successful provides social proof for participants.</p><p>In addition, scaling up research into relatively new cause areas is a problem that will need to be solved many times in the effective altruist community. This could represent an efficient way to ‘bootstrap’ a larger research community from a small pre-existing one, and so could be a useful addition to the tool set available to the EA community.</p><p>This project serves as a natural complement to other AI safety projects currently in development such as <u><a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Road_to_AI_Safety_Excellence\">RAISE</a></u> that aim to teach researchers the foundational knowledge they will need to begin research. Once an aspiring AI safety researcher completes one of these courses, they might consider a research camp as a natural next step on the road to become a practicing researcher.</p><h3 id=\"Acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3><p>Thanks to Ryan Carey, Chris Cundy, Victoria Krakovna and Matthijs Maas for reading and providing helpful comments on this document.</p><h3 id=\"Organisers\">Organisers</h3><h4 id=\"Tom_McGrath\"><u><a href=\"https://tommcgrath.github.io/\">Tom McGrath</a></u></h4><p>Tom is a maths PhD student in the <u><a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nsjones/\">Systems and Signals</a></u> group at Imperial College, where he works on statistical models of animal behaviour and physical models of inference.

Get people started on and immersed into concrete research work intended to lead to papers for publication.\n2.  Address the bottleneck in AI safety/strategy of few experts being available to train or organize aspiring researchers by efficiently using expert time.\n3.  Create a clear path from ‘interested/concerned’ to ‘active researcher’.\n4.  Test a new method for bootstrapping talent-constrained research fields.\n\n**Method:** Run an online research group culminating in a two week intensive in-person research camp. Participants will work in groups on tightly-defined research projects on the following topics:\n\n*   Agent foundations\n*   Machine learning safety\n*   Policy & strategy\n*   Human values\n\nProjects will be proposed by participants prior to the start of the program. Expert advisors from AI Safety/Strategy organisations will help refine them into proposals that are tractable, suitable for this research environment, and answer currently unsolved research questions. This allows for time-efficient use of advisors’ domain knowledge and research experience, and ensures that research is well-aligned with current priorities.\n\nParticipants will then split into groups to work on these research questions in online collaborative groups over a period of several months. This period will culminate in a two week in-person research camp aimed at turning this exploratory research into first drafts of publishable research papers. This will also allow for cross-disciplinary conversations and community building, although the goal is primarily research output. Following the two week camp, advisors will give feedback on manuscripts, guiding first drafts towards completion and advising on next steps for researchers.\n\n**Example:** Multiple participants submit a research proposal or otherwise express an interest in interruptibility during the application process, and in working on machine learning-based approaches. During the initial idea generation phase, these researchers read one another’s research proposals and decide to collaborate based on their shared interests. They decide to code up and test a variety of novel approaches on the relevant AI safety gridworld. These approaches get formalised in a research plan.\n\nThis plan is circulated among advisors, who identify the most promising elements to prioritise and point out flaws that render some proposed approaches unworkable. Participants feel encouraged by expert advice and support, and research begins on the improved research proposal.\n\nResearchers begin formalising and coding up these approaches, sharing their work in a Github repository that they can use as evidence of their engineering ability. It becomes clear that a new gridworld is needed to investigate issues arising from research so far. After a brief conversation, their advisor is able to put them in touch with the relevant engineer at Deepmind, who gives them some useful tips on creating this.\n\nAt the research camp the participants are able to discuss their findings and put them in context, as well as solve some technical issues that were impossible to resolve part-time and remotely. They write up their findings into a draft paper and present it at the end of the camp. The paper is read and commented on by advisors, who give suggestions on how to improve the paper’s clarity. The paper is submitted to NIPS 2018’s Aligned AI workshop and is accepted.\n\n**Expected outcome:** Each research group will aim to produce results that can form the kernel of a paper at the end of the July camp. We don’t expect every group to achieve this, as research progress is hard to predict.\n\n1.  At the end of the camp, from five groups, we would expect three to have initial results and a first draft of a paper that the expert advisors find promising.\n2.  Within six months following the camp, three or more draft papers have been written that are considered to be promising by the research community.\n3.  Within one year following the camp, three or more researchers who participated in the project obtain funding or research roles in AI safety or strategy.\n\n**Next steps following the camp:** When teams have produced promising results, camp organizers and expert advisors will endeavour to connect the teams to the right parties to help the research shape up further and be taken to conclusion.\n\nPossible destinations for participants who wish to remain in research after the camp would likely be some combination of:\n\n1.  Full-time internships in areas of interest, for instance [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/careers/476630/), [FHI](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/vacancies/) or [CHAI](http://humancompatible.ai/jobs#internship)\n2.  Full-time research roles at AI safety/strategy organisations\n3.  Obtaining research funding such as [OpenPhil](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/open-philanthropy-project-ai-fellows-program) or [FLI](https://futureoflife.org/2017/12/20/2018-international-ai-safety-grants-competition/) research grants - successful publications may unlock new sources of funding\n4.  Independent remote research\n5.  Research engineering roles at technical AI safety organisations\n\nResearch projects can be tailored towards participants’ goals - for instance researchers who are interested in engineering or machine learning-related approaches to safety can structure a project to include a significant coding element, leading to (for instance) a GitHub repo that can be used as evidence of engineering skill. This is also a relatively easy way for people who are unsure if research work is for them to try it out without the large time investment and opportunity cost of a PhD or masters program, although we do not see it as a full replacement for these.\n\n### Plan\n\n**[Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l02CtyQo-sUiXv4RlwRB2DHOXyS6pC7_lGcx0vxOOtY/edit):** We anticipate this project having 4 main phases (dates are currently open for discussion):\n\n1.  Plan and develop the project, recruit researchers and look for advisors - December 2017 to April 2018\n2.  Testing and refinement of event design during a small-scale camp at Gran Canaria - April 12-22\n3.  Project selection, refinement and exploration (online) - April 2018 to July 2018\n4.  Research camp (in person) - July/August 2018\n\n**Recruiting:** We plan to have approximately 20 researchers working in teams of 3-5 people, with projects in agent foundations, machine learning, strategy/policy and human values/cognition. Based on responses to a registration form we have already posted online (link [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xj7ffjihLyIqtPPEMozwnHA3HsKhzFD7ZxblVkA1O5g)) we expect to be able to easily meet this number of participants.\n\nEach team will be advised by a more experienced researcher in the relevant area, however we expect this won’t be as tightly-coupled a relationship as that between PhD students and their supervisors - the aim is to maximise the usefulness of the relatively scarce advisor time and to develop as much independence in researchers as possible.\n\n**Project selection and exploration:** Once the initial recruitment phase is complete, researchers and advisors can choose a project to work on and refine it into a single question answerable within the timeframe. We recognise the need for strong project planning skills and careful project choice and refinement here, and this project choice is a potential point of failure (see Important Considerations below). Following project selection, researchers will begin exploring the research project they’ve chosen in the months between project choice and the research camp. This would probably require five to ten hours a week of commitment from researchers, mostly asynchronously but with a weekly ‘scrum’ meeting to share progress within a project team. Regular sharing of progress and forward planning will be important to keep momentum going.\n\n**Research camp:** Following the selection and exploration, we will have a two-week intensive camp assembling all participants in-person at a retreat to do focused work on the research projects. Exploratory work can be done asynchronously, but finishing research projects can be hard work and require intensive communication which can more easily be done in person. This also makes the full-time element of this project much more bounded and manageable for most potential participants. An in-person meeting also allows for much better communication between researchers on different projects, as well as helping form lasting and fruitful connections between researchers.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n**Shaping the research question:** Selecting good research questions for this project will be challenging, and is one of the main potential points of failure. The non-traditional structure of the event brings with it some extra considerations. We expect that most projects will be:\n\n1.  Tractable to allow progress to be made in a short period of time, rather than conceptually complex or open-ended\n2.  Closely related to current work, e.g. suggestions found in ‘further work’ or ‘open questions’ sections from recent papers\n3.  Parallelisable across multiple researchers, e.g. evaluating multiple possible solutions to a single problem or researching separate aspects of a policy proposal\n\nThis biases project selection towards incremental research, i.e. extending previous work rather than finding completely new approaches. This is hard to avoid in these circumstances, and we are optimising at least partly for the creation of new researchers who can go on to do more risky, less incremental research in the future. Furthermore, a look at the ‘future work/open questions’ sections of many published safety papers will reveal a broad selection of interesting, useful questions that still meet the criteria above so although this is a tradeoff, we do not expect it to be overly limiting. A good example of this in the Machine Learning subfield would be evaluating multiple approaches to one of the problems listed in DeepMind’s recent [AI Safety gridworlds paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09883).\n\n**Finding advisors:** Although we intend this to be relatively self-contained, some amount of advice from active researchers will be beneficial at both the project selection and research stages, as well as at the end of the camp. The most useful periods for advisor involvement will be at the initial project selection/shaping phase and at the end of the camp - the former allows for better, more tractable projects as well as conveying previously unpublished relevant information and a sense of what’s considered interesting. The latter will be useful for preparing papers and integrating new researchers into the existing community. Informal enquiries suggest that it is likely to be possible to recruit advisors for these stages, but ongoing commitments will be more challenging.\n\nThe expected commitment during project selection and shaping would be one or two sessions of several hours spent evaluating and commenting on proposed research projects. This could be done asynchronously or by video chat. Commitment at the end of the research camp is likely to be similar - responding to initial drafts of papers with suggestions of improvements or further research in a similar way to the peer review process.\n\n**Costs:** The main costs for the Gran Canaria camp, the AirBnBs, meals and low-income travel reimbursements, have been covered now by two funders. The July camp will likely take place in the UK at the [EA Hotel](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624791014242988/?ref=br_rs), a co-working hub planned by Greg Colbourn (for other options, see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cX4yrEH4Kw8-CdT9zRhV7EHD1xXLO6T9NqiK5FQ5pKk/edit#gid=0)). For this, we will publish a funding proposal around April. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P5W8u8czOp_MEaZtb2iwPmmFs1CFkkH6RuI0NHrfP_I/edit#gid=781421298) for the draft budgets.\n\n### Long-term and wider impacts\n\nIf the camp proves to be successful, it could serve as the foundation for yearly recurring camps to keep boosting aspiring researchers into productivity. It could become a much-needed additional lever to grow the fields of AI safety and AI strategy for many years to come. The research camp model could also be used to grow AI safety research communities where none presently exist, but there is a strong need - in China, for instance. By using experienced coordinators and advisors in conjunction with local volunteers, it may be possible to organise a research camp without the need for pre-existing experts in the community. A camp provides a coordination point for interested participants, signals support for community building, and if previous camps have been successful provides social proof for participants.\n\nIn addition, scaling up research into relatively new cause areas is a problem that will need to be solved many times in the effective altruist community. This could represent an efficient way to ‘bootstrap’ a larger research community from a small pre-existing one, and so could be a useful addition to the tool set available to the EA community.\n\nThis project serves as a natural complement to other AI safety projects currently in development such as [RAISE](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Road_to_AI_Safety_Excellence) that aim to teach researchers the foundational knowledge they will need to begin research. Once an aspiring AI safety researcher completes one of these courses, they might consider a research camp as a natural next step on the road to become a practicing researcher.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Ryan Carey, Chris Cundy, Victoria Krakovna and Matthijs Maas for reading and providing helpful comments on this document.\n\n### Organisers\n\n#### [Tom McGrath](https://tommcgrath.github.io/)\n\nTom is a maths PhD student in the [Systems and Signals](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~nsjones/) group at Imperial College, where he works on statistical models of animal behaviour and physical models of inference.

I may choose to ask for clarifications on your design; you may also choose to edit the submission to add clarifications (label these as edits).\n\nIt may be useful for you to include details of the physical setup, what the Oracle is trying to maximise/minimise/predict and what the counterfactual behaviour of the Oracle users humans are assumed to be (in the counterfactual Oracle setup). Explanations as to how your design is safe or useful could be helpful, unless it's obvious.

The Oracle is run once an episode only (and other Oracles can't generally be used on the same problem; if you want to run multiple Oracles, you have to justify why this would work), and has to get objective/loss/reward by the end of that episode, which therefore has to be estimated in some way at that point.\n"

      "markdown": "  \n\n_Background Context, And How to Read This Post_  \n\n_This post is inspired by and a continuation of comments I made on the post '[What is the Rationalist Berkeley Community's Culture?](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/)' by Zvi on his blog [Don't Worry About the Vase](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/). As a community organizer both online and in-person in Vancouver, Canada, my goal was to fill in what appeared to be some gaps in the conversation among rationalists mostly focused on the Berkeley community. Zvi's post was part of a broader conversation pertaining to rationalist community dynamics **within** Berkeley. _\n\n_My commentary pertains to the dynamics **between** the Bay Area and other local rationality communities, informed by my own experience in Vancouver and those of rationalists elsewhere. The below should not be taken be taken as comment on rationalist community dynamics **within** the Bay Area. This post should be considered an off-shoot from the original conversation Zvi was contributing to. For full context, please read Zvi's [original post](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/). _\n\n* * *\n\nI. The Rationality Community: Berkeley vs. The World  \n\nWhile I didn't respond to them at the time, several community members commented on Zvi's post they had similar experiences: that while some local rationality communities and their members perceive themselves in a zero-sum game with Berkeley they didn't sign up for (and, to be fair, the Berkeley community didn't consciously initiate as though it's a single agency), and some don't, a sense of what Zvi was trying to point appears ubiquitous. An example:\n\n> In my experience, the recruitment to Berkeley was very aggressive. Sometimes it felt like: “if you don’t want to move to Berkeley as soon as possible, you are not \\*really\\* rational, and then it is a waste of our time to even talk to you.” I totally understand why having more rationalists around you is awesome, but trying to move everyone into one city feels like an overkill.\n\nSimilar anecdata from local rationality communities around the world:\n\n_Melbourne._ When I met several rationalists originally from Melbourne in Berkeley a few years ago, the way they talked about the exodus of the core of the Melbourne rationality community to the Bay Area, it was a mixed assessment. Melbourne is an example of very successful local rationality community outside the Bay Area, with the usual milestones like successful EA non-profits, for-profit start-ups and rationalist sharehouses. So that many rationalists from Melbourne left for the Bay Area passed a cost-benefit analysis as high-impact individuals it was obvious to them they should be reducing existential risks on the other side of the world.\n\nIn conversation, Helen Toner expressed some unease that a local rationality community which had successfully become a rationality hub second only to the Bay Area had had a whole generation of rationalists from Melbourne leave at once. This could have left open the possibility a sustainable system for rationalist development for years had been gutted. My impression since then is around this time the independent organization of the Melbourne EA community began to pick up, and between that and the remaining rationalists, the Melbourne community is doing well. If past or present members of the Melbourne rationality community would like to add their two cents, it would be greatly appreciated.   \n  \nThe rationality community growth strategy out of Berkeley by default became to recruit the best rationalists from local communities around the world at a rate faster than rationalist organizers could replenish the strength of those local communities. Given the stories I've heard from outside Melbourne being more lopsided, with the organization of local rationality communities utterly collapsing, only recovering after multiple years if ever, I'd consider the case of Melbourne rationality community surviving the exit of its leadership for Berkeley to have been a lucky outlier.\n\n  \n_Seattle._ The Seattle rationality community has experienced a bad case of exodus to Berkeley over the last few years. My understanding of this story is as follow:\n\n*   Like with rationalists around the world, effective altruism came along and said \"hey, while our communities have significant differences, we care about existential risk reduction and other common goals; we've got several billion dollars; and worldwide network of thousands rising through every kind of institution to coordinate the globe\". At the time, the whole strategy for AI alignment wasn't much more than \"read the Sequences and then donate to MIRI...?\", so at the time EA's value proposition couldn't be beat. In Seattle the organizers of the rationality community took off their rationalist hats and switched it for an effective altruist one, albeit while prominently placing a rationalist button on it. This is what started happening in Vancouver as well circa 2013. The Seattle rationalists started a successful Rationality Reading Group in 2015 which got through the whole LessWrong Sequences.  \n    \n*   Things went swimmingly in Seattle until [AI safety 'went mainstream'](https://futureoflife.org/2015/12/31/2015-a-year-in-review/), and as the financial resources flowed into the institutions of the Berkeley rationality community, the demand and pressure to acquire the resources that were distant rationalists and their skill-sets intensified. In a period of several months but less than two years, the Seattle rationality community lost at least a half-dozen members, including some local organizers and other veteran community members. The Rationality Reading Groups ceased as regular meetups for over a year, and local community organization was at best intermittent.   \n    \n*   The excitement of EA brought many more Seattleites into the world of x-risk reduction, and the EA and rationality communities of Seattle effectively merged to survive. Since then, they're thriving again, but Seattle is still gradually exuding community members to Berkeley. Because of its proximity to the Bay Area, and the excellence of the Seattle rationality community, I expect it might have experienced more _absolute_ loss from leaking members to Berkeley more than any other. Due to its size, the Seattle community has sustained itself, so the _relative_ loss of local rationality communities which totally collapsed may be greater than has been the case in Seattle. As with Melbourne, if any community members who have lived or are living in Seattle wish to provide feedback, that is encouraged. \n\n_Vancouver._ The experience in Vancouver has in the past certainly felt like \"“if you don’t want to move to Berkeley as soon as possible, you are not \\*really\\* rational\". The biggest reason Vancouver may not have exuded as many rationalists to the Bay Area as cities in the United States is the difficulty being Canadian poses to gaining permanent residence in the United States and hence moving to the Bay Area. A couple friends of mine who were early attendees of a CFAR workshop lived in the Bay Area for several months in 2013, and returned home with stories of how wondrous the Bay Area was. They convinced several of us to attend CFAR workshops as well, and we too returned home with the sense of wonderment after our brief immersion in the Berkeley rationality community. But when my friends and I each returned, somehow our ambition transformed into depression. I tried rallying my friends to try carrying back or reigniting the spark that made the Berkeley rationalist community thrive, to really spread the rationalist project beyond the Bay Area. \n\nBut the apparent consensus was it just wasn't possible. Maybe the rationality community a few years ago lacked the language to talk about it, but rationalists who'd lived in Berkeley for a time only to return felt the rationality-shaped hole in their heart could only be filled in the Berkeley. A malaise had fallen over the Vancouver rationality community. All of us were still around, but with a couple local EA organizations, many of us were drawn to that crowd. Those of us who weren't were alienated from any personal connection to the rationality community. I saw in my friends a bunch of individual heroes who together were strangely less than and  not greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThings have been better lately, and a friend remarked they're certainly better than a few years ago, when everyone was depressed about the fact it was too difficult for us to all move to the Bay Area. In the last several months, the local rationality community has taken on as our mission our own development, and we've not rebounded so much as flourished like never before. But it took the sorts of conversations about the Berkeley rationalist community last year Zvi and others had to break the spell we had cast on ourselves, that apparently Berkeley had running a rationalist community like a well-oiled machine down to an art and a science.\n\n* * *\n\nII. The Berkeley Community and the Mission of Rationality\n\n_Benquo [commented](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/#comment-479) on Zvi's post:_\n\n> This is a good description of why I feel like I need to leave Berkeley whether or not there’s a community somewhere else to participate in. This thing is scary and I don’t want to be part of it.\n\n>   \n> I think this is some evidence that the Rationalist project was never or only very briefly real and almost immediately overrun by [MOPs](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths), and largely functions as a way for people to find mates. Maybe that’s OK in a lot of cases, but when your branding is centered around “no really, we are actually trying to do the thing, literally all we are about is not lying to ourselves and instead openly talking about the thing we’re trying to do, if you take things literally saving the world really literally is the most important thing and so of course you do it,” it’s pretty disappointing to find it’s just another flavor.\n\nSince he wrote this comment, Benquo has actually continued to participate in the rationality community. This conversation was mired in tension in the rationality community it must have been difficult to think about impersonally, and so a charitable interpretation would be while these problems exist, Benquo and others are generally not as fatalistic about the rationality community as they were the time they wrote the comments. While I and others in thread saw grains of truth in Benquo's statement, precision nonetheless remains a [virtue of rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/the-twelve-virtues-of-rationality), and I [felt compelled](https://www.xkcd.com/386/) to clarify. I [commented](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/#comment-484):\n\n> I’d say the rationality community started whenever Eliezer forked off LessWrong Overcoming Bias, which was around 2008 or 2009. That’s certainly not when it peaked. Even in a way MIRI never was, CFAR started out a project built by the rationality community. That was happening in 2012 or 2013. Above Sarah is also quoted as saying she thinks the Berkeley rationality community hit the right balance of focusing on being a welcoming community qua community, and aspiring to the whatever the core mission(s) of the aspiring rationalist project are.\n\n>   \n> Unless you’re arguing there was a latency effect where the MOPs overran the community in 2009, but the consequences of such were buried for several years, the period between 2008/09 and 2012/13 doesn’t constitute being “immediately overrun”.\n\n>   \n> I get you’re pessimistic, but I think you’re overshooting. Matching the map to the territory of what went wrong in the Berkeley rationality community is key to undoing it, or making sure similar failures don’t occur in the future.  \n> FWIW, I’m sorry you’ve had to experience so directly what you feel like is a decline in an aspect of your local rationality community. As someone who connects with rationalists primarily online, I can tell you they’re everywhere, and even if there isn’t a meatspace community as developed as the one in Berkeley, there are rationalists who won’t let the Craft disappear everywhere, and they want meatspace communities of their own built up outside of Berkeley as much as anyone.\n\nOther comments in-thread from community members who had been around longer than Benquo or I confirmed my impression from their own personal experiences, so unless Benquo would further dispute these accounts, this thread seems put to rest. However, Zvi then [replied](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/#comment-479) to me:\n\n> I think we need to realize the extent to which Berkeley is actively preventing the formation of, and destroying, these other communities. The majority of high-level rationalists who started in the New York community are in the Berkeley community, which caused New York to outright collapse for years before recovering, and they just now once again caused a crisis by taking away a pair of vital community members and almost wiping out the only rationalist group space in the process. From meeting other community leaders in other cities, I hear similar stories A LOT.\n\n>   \n> I do agree that Plan A for most members can and should be Fix It, not walking away, and that pointing out it needs fixing is the requirement for perhaps fixing it.\n\nTo respond to Zvi here, indeed it appears to be an uncannily ubiquitous problem. I've collected a few stories and described them in some detail above. Between that and several comments from independent rationalists on Zvi's original post giving the impression members of their local communities were being sucked to Berkeley as though through a pneumatic tube and leaving a vacuum of community and organization in its wake, it appears these many local stories could be a single global one.  \n\nThe original mission of the rationality community was to raise the sanity waterline to ensure human values get carried to the stars, but we're [still godshatter](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cSXZpvqpa9vbGGLtG/thou-art-godshatter), so doing so can and should take different forms than just ensuring superintelligence is aligned with human values. If ever the goal was to seed successful, stable rationalist communities outside Berkeley to coordinate projects beyond the Bay Area, it's been two steps forward, one step back, at best. Even if we assume for the sake of argument it's a good idea for rationalists worldwide to view Berkeley as a nucleus and their own rationalist communities as recruitment centres to drive promising individuals to Berkeley for the mission of AI alignment or whatever, the plan isn't working super well. That's because the apparent rate of local rationalist communities sending their highest-level rationalists Berkeley is occurring at a much faster rate than those rationalist communities can level up more rationalists to replenish their leadership and sustain the local community _at all_.  \n\nThe state of affairs could be worse than it is now. But it creates the possibility that if enough local rationalist communities around the world outside the Bay Area simultaneously collapsed, the Berkeley rationalist community (BRC) could lose sufficient channels for recruitment to sustain itself. Given the tendency of communities like all things toward entropy, communities decay over time. The BRC could not be rubbing any of its members the wrong way and we would probably still observe some naturally occurring attrition. In a scenario where the decay rate of the BRC was greater than its rate of replenishment, which has historically largely depended on rationalists from outside communities, the BRC would start decaying. If we were to assume the BRC acts as a single agency, it's in the BRC's self-interest as the nucleus of the worldwide rationality movement to sustain communities-as-recruitment centres at least to the extent they can sustainably drive their highest-level rationalists to Berkeley over the long-term.\n\nWhile this worst-case scenario could apply to any large-scale rationalist project, with regards to AI alignment, if the locus of control for the field falls out of the hands of the rationality community, [someone](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/) [else](https://openai.com/) might notice and decide to pick up that slack. This could be a sufficiently bad outcome rationalists everywhere should pay more attention to decreasing the chances of it happening.  \n\nSo whether a rationalist sees the outcome of the primary purpose of rationalist communities acting as a recruitment centres for the Berkeley rationalist community as an excellent plan or an awful failure mode, there's a significant chance it's unsustainable either way. It appears a high-risk strategy that's far from foolproof, and as far as I know virtually nobody is consciously monitoring the situation to prevent further failure.\n\n* * *\n\nIII. Effective Altruism and the Rationalist Community\n\nIn another thread, I responded directly to Zvi. I [commented](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/#comment-485):\n\n> While rationalists are internally trying to figure out how there community has changed, and they’re lamenting how it’s not as focused on world-saving, there’s a giant factor nobody has talked about yet. The only community which is more focused on the rationality community’s way of world-saving than the rationality community is effective altruism. To what extent is the rationalist community less world-save-y than it used to be because the rationalists whose primary rationalist role was “world saver” just switched to EA as their primary world-saving identity. I think as things have gotten less focused since LessWrong 1.0 died, and the rationalist diaspora made entryism much easier as standards fell, what you’re saying is all true. You might be overestimating the impact of entryism, though, and underestimating people who exited not because they had no voice, but for sensible reasons. If at any point a rationalist felt they could better save the world within the EA rather than through the rationality community, it’d internally make sense to dedicate one’s time and energy to that community instead.\n\n>   \n> The EA community doesn’t seem able to build bonds as well as the rationality community. However, the EA community seems better at making progress on outward-facing goals. In that case, I for one wouldn’t blame anyone who find more at home as a world-saver in EA than they did in the rationalist community.\n\nZvi [replied](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/what-is-rationalist-berkleys-community-culture/#comment-489):\n\n> Definitely an elephant in the room and a reasonable suspect! Certainly partially responsible. I haven’t mentioned it yet, but that doesn’t mean I’ve missed that it is in the picture. I wanted to get this much out there now, and avoid trying to cover as many bases as possible all at once.\n\n>   \n> There have been many (Sarah \\[Constantin\\] and Benquo among them) who have been trying to talk for a long time, with many many words, about the problems with EA. I will consider that question beyond scope here, but rest assured I Have Thoughts.\n\nSince then Zvi and others have made good on their intentions to point out said problems with effective altruism. I intend to engage these thoughts at length in the future, but suffice to say for now local rationalist communities outside the Bay Area appear to definitely have experienced being 'eaten' by EA worse than Berkeley.\n\n* * *\n\nI never bothered to tie up the loose ends I saw in the comments on Zvi's post last year, but something recently spurred me to do so. From Benquo's recent post '[Humans need places](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PSAn7WGKCGhXet6A8/humans-need-places)':\n\n> I am not arguing that it would merely be a nice thing for Bay Arean EAs and Rationalists to support projects like this; I am arguing that if you have supported recruiting more people into your community, it is morally obligatory to offer a corresponding level of support for taking care of them once you are in community with them. If you can’t afford to help take care of people, you can’t afford to recruit them.\n\n>   \n> If you don’t have enough for yourself, take care of that first. But if you have more than enough to take care of your private needs, and you are thinking of allocating your surplus to some combination of (a) people far away in space or time, and (b) recruiting others to do the same, I implore you, please first assess - even approximately - the correct share of resources devoted to direct impact, recruiting more people into your community, and _taking care of the community’s needs_, and give accordingly.  \n> \\[...\\]  \n> The Berkeley EA / Rationalist community stands between two alternatives:  \n\n> 1.Pull people in, use them up, and burn them out.  \n> 2\\. Building the local infrastructure to support its global ambitions, enabling sustainable commitments that replenish and improve the capacity of the people making them.\n\nIt's important for rationalists in Berkeley to know that from where they're standing, to rationalists around the world, these statements could ring hollow. The perception of the Centre for Effective Altruism slighting the Berkeley REACH is mirrored many times over in rationalists feeling like Berkeley pulled in, used up and burned out whole rationalist communities. The capital of a nation receives resources from everyone across the land. If the capital city recruits more citizens to the nation, is it not morally obligatory for the capital city offer a corresponding level of support for taking care of them once they joined your nation? Is it not the case if the rationality community can not afford to take care of our people, then we can't afford to recruit them?  \n\nThe worldwide rationalist project stands between two alternatives:\n\n1.  Seed new local communities, use them up, and burn them out.\n2.  Building the global infrastructure to support its global ambitions, enabling sustainable commitments that replenish and improve the capacity of the local communities making them.\n\nThis isn't about the Berkeley rationalist community, but rationalist communities everywhere. In reading about the experiences of rationalists in Berkeley and elsewhere, I've learned their internal coordination problems are paralleled in rationalist communities everywhere. The good news in the bad news is if all rationalist communities face common problems, we can all benefit from working towards common solutions. So global coordination may not be as difficult as one might think. I wrote above the Vancouver rationality community has recently taken on as our mission our own development, and we're not recovering from years of failures past so much as flourishing like never before. We haven't solved all the problems a rationalist community might face, but we've been solving a lot. As a local community organizer, I developed tactics for doing so that if they worked in Vancouver, they should work for any rationalist community. And they worked in Vancouver. I think they're some of the pieces of the puzzle of building global infrastructure to match the rationality community's global ambitions. To lay that out will be the subject of my next post."

      "html": "<p>I was the Creative Director for last year’s Winter Solstice in the Bay Area. I worked with Nat Kozak and Chelsea Voss, who were both focused more on logistics. Chelsea was also the official leader who oversaw both me and Nat and had final say on disputes. (However, I was granted dictatorial control over the Solstice arc and had final say in that arena.) I legit have no idea how any one of us would have pulled this off without the others; love to both of them and also massive respect to Cody Wild, who somehow ran the entire thing herself in 2018.</p><p>While I worked with a bunch of other people on Solstice, all opinions expressed here are my own.&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"Process\">Process</h1><h2 id=\"Beginnings___research_phase\">Beginnings &amp; research phase</h2><p>Chelsea, Nat, and I spent just about a full year preparing for Solstice. Our first meeting as a group was on January 20th, and we received official confirmation that we’d be in charge about a month later. In the following month, the three of us had roughly weekly planning meetings via video chat. In the first meeting, we set goals for what we wanted to have done by the first of April, and after that we checked in regularly for a while.</p><p>My goal by the first of April was to have a rough outline of the entire arc and a plan for how to make the tone be coherent. I also wanted to get a better handle on the task, and to that end I had conversations with several previous Solstice organizers and also read as much as I could. This included Ray’s sequence on ritual, most of the writing on the Secular Solstice website (both the <a href=\"http://secularsolstice.com/blog/\"><u>blog</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://secularsolstice.com/resources/\"><u>resources</u></a> section were useful), discussions on the Rational Ritual Facebook group, and whatever else I could find.&nbsp;</p><p>I also spent a full day listening to every single song that had ever been recommended for Solstice (see below) and making notes on them in a spreadsheet. When I ran out of songs in that reference class, I sorted my iTunes library by most listens and started going through to see if any of those songs might fit. This was quite surprisingly fruitful - I actually ended up using three of the songs that were originally put on my list in this way.</p><p>Another thing I did was go around and ask people what they wanted out of Solstice. I got responses that were actually fairly useful, like “I lose interest during long speeches” and “there should be more singalongs” and “I like singalongs but a lot of the songs have really complicated tunes and I can’t handle it.”</p><p>I think even with all that research and preparation, I still didn’t have a very good sense of the history of Solstice. I had only been to two big Bay Area Solstices, plus a private Solstice in the woods, plus a short, small, off-the-cuff Solstice that Habryka and I ran at my mom’s house in 2018. I wasn’t around for early Solstices, and I’d never seen what they were like in Boston, Seattle, or New York.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"Creating_the_setlist\">Creating the setlist</h2><p><strong id=\"The_first_setlist\">The first setlist</strong></p><p>I met the April 1st deadline for having an outline of the entire arc. I drew up my first setlist in my notebook on a five-hour plane ride. I was taking into consideration more small snippets of advice than I can list here, but I can quote the guiding goal I referred to throughout the entirety of my time working on this Solstice:</p><blockquote><p>I want my Solstice to be about the brokenness of the world and the ethos of \"somebody has to and no one else will\", but also the fact that even if you exercise your individual agency to do the most you can, we still might fail.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Below are some sample pages from my notebook, with most names redacted. Note that I didn't ask any of these people before assigning them to songs; this was just idle speculation on a plane ride about who might be able to pull off each song.</p><figure

notebook</figcaption></figure><p>After that was a process of constant iteration.&nbsp;</p><p><strong id=\"Run_throughs\">Run-throughs</strong></p><p>We had our first full run-through of the setlist on June 16th. In the two months leading up to this, Chelsea checked in with me weekly. I had a lot of speeches to write and planned to write one and send it to her each week (which I more or less accomplished). I found this accountability mechanism quite helpful.</p><p>The first run-through was just me, Habryka, and Chelsea. We sat on the floor of my bedroom, played recordings of the songs to sing along with, and took turns reading the speeches. For this run-through, I wrote three new speeches, re-used two existing Solstice speeches, and threw in Pale Blue Dot, an abridged version of the poem <a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/memoriam-ring-out-wild-bells\"><u>Ring Out, Wild Bells</u></a>, and the Sequences post <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible\"><u>On Doing The Impossible</u></a>. After the run-through, which took about two hours (we timed each piece), the three of us debriefed, and I used the extensive notes I took to make changes to the setlist.</p><p>I felt burned out after this and had the luxury of taking all of July off from Solstice work. This was a huge benefit of starting so early.</p><p>The next run-through was in September, scheduled around the dates when our featured musician, Taylor (who lives in Vermont) would be in town. This was significantly more involved but still fairly informal. Seven people participated in total (including Ray, who was experimenting with projection), we provided our own instrumentation for most of the songs, and most of the speeches were read by the people who would eventually give them. Afterwards, each person individually gave me feedback, and again, I made significant changes to the setlist in response.</p><h2 id=\"Regular_coworking_hours\">Regular coworking hours</h2><p>Around the time of the September run-through, things really picked up. Going into crunch time, Chelsea, Nat, and I set up a regular time for Solstice coworking. We met for a couple hours every Monday night - that served both as our designated time to work on Solstice things (since we all also have day jobs) and an opportunity for in-person communication about high-context or sensitive topics.</p><h2 id=\"Choosing_performers\">Choosing performers</h2><p><strong id=\"Skill_level\">Skill level</strong></p><p>We put out a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/193wc6UEsvfm-_tQGKZRkCWU6yrb5XU6CGhA1pt2xpdk/edit\"><u>call for auditions</u></a> in August, but we didn’t publicize it very well, so we didn’t receive many applications. I required auditions for speakers and singalong vocalists, but not for instrumentalists - in retrospect, this was an obvious mistake. I let almost all of the instrumentalists who applied participate in as many songs as they wanted, but there were issues with everything from not having time to rehearse to not being able to play in the key the vocalist wanted to disagreements on chords and time signatures.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we didn’t get enough applications to fill all the slots, I reached out to people who I already knew were competent from seeing them perform in previous Solstices or in other contexts (such as at jam sessions or in the REACH Musical Revue). This ended up working quite well - I think that everyone I chose in this way gave a good performance.</p><p>NYC has often hired professional musicians, rather than having community members provide the instrumentation - a possibility I knew about but never seriously considered. While I still wouldn’t pay for professional musicians, I’ve come to understand better why someone might decide to do so, after experiencing the difficulties (mentioned above) of getting amateur musicians to produce a performance-ready piece.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of the amateurs did do an excellent job! So I think the takeaway here is just that it’s important to have people audition (or be very sure of their competence level in some other way) and make sure they’re able to put in the time commitment to rehearse.</p><p><strong id=\"Orientation_towards_Solstice_as_a_whole\">Orientation towards Solstice as a whole</strong></p><p>Something I struggled with a fair amount was disagreements about arc cohesion vs showcasing technical skill. Arc cohesion trumped all other concerns for me, with singalongability a close second. However, it’s often the case that when singers are given the chance to perform, they want to do something more interesting than just lead the melody of a singalong, so I was sometimes at loggerheads with performers who wanted to do more complex pieces or include intricate harmonies. There are some pieces for which I regret not being firmer about putting my foot down on this issue, and I think that ultimately it’s probably reasonable to exclude performers on this basis if you can’t come to an agreement.</p><p>On the flip side, I was extremely grateful to the people whose pieces I cut after the dress rehearsal, a week before the performance. I apologized to all of them and gave them the opportunity to contest the decision, but they were all really great about it and said things along the lines of “I care way more about Solstice being better than I do about cashing out on the work I did.” To those people - I really appreciate you, and thank you for being wonderful!</p><h2 id=\"Final_preparations\">Final preparations</h2><p>In late November we did a walk-through of the venue (important for testing planetarium footage and lighting options), then in early December we had a tech rehearsal at the planetarium (mostly for A/V) and a dress rehearsal (not at the planetarium). Much of the benefit here was logistical, and I won’t touch on that too much since it’s not my wheelhouse, but it also gave me a chance to see what the final product would be like. I was originally supposed to stop editing the setlist entirely on November 5th, but in reality, I made several changes to the order and even cut some pieces in response to the dress rehearsal, and the exact content of some things was kind of up in the air even on the day of. While I technically missed my deadline or whatever, I don’t regret that at all - I think my Solstice was quite significantly better than it would have been if I had stopped iterating on the setlist a month earlier.</p><h1 id=\"Considerations_for_creating_a_setlist\">Considerations for creating a setlist</h1><h2 id=\"Creating_a_cohesive_message\">Creating a cohesive message</h2><p>When it came to speeches, I took an arc-first approach. I decided what message fit in every place in the arc and found a piece that fit there. Only after that did I approach potential speakers. I ended up using four existing pieces wholesale; the rest were based on existing pieces but were either remixed or heavily edited by the speaker. The takeaway action item here is to have something very specific in mind for each speech and conveying that to the speaker. This improves cohesion while still allowing each speaker to put their own twist on the piece if they so choose.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Tessa remixed Ray’s <i>A Bottomless Pit of Suffering </i>to make more sense in Berkeley (it was originally given in NYC, where it’s very cold) and to have more of her own voice.</li><li>I had Nate Soares on the docket from quite early on in the process, but he’s busy executive-directing MIRI so I didn’t want to take up too much of his time. With his input, I chose an old post from his blog for him to read (<a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/how-we-will-be-measured/\"><i><u>How We Will Be Measured</u></i></a>), and Chelsea and I edited it to be shorter and more appropriate as a speech. Nate then made a bunch of his own changes to reflect the ways his thinking has changed over the past few years, but ultimately it was still recognizable as the same piece.</li><li>Though it ended up being cut at the very last minute, Alex Altair adapted a scene from HPMoR into a speech, which was pretty cool.</li></ul><h2 id=\"Creating_a_smooth_arc\">Creating a smooth arc</h2><p>In order to create a smooth experience, you have to make sure that there are smooth transitions&nbsp; between the message, emotional tone, and musical/artistic feel of each piece and the next. It turns out to be really hard to match these all up. For example, there are some funny/upbeat/light-hearted songs about death (e.g. <i>We Will All Go Together When We Go</i>), and some fairly serious-sounding songs about more light-hearted topics (e.g. <i>Time Wrote the Rocks</i>). Some songs are up-tempo, some are slow and mournful, some have percussion, some are performed by choir. There are just a ton of considerations. (This is why Ray writes so many of his own songs - that’s the only way you can really have control over the message, tone, and feel all at once.)</p><p>I was aware of all of these considerations, and that’s a big part of the reason that I made sure to run through each version of the setlist from start to finish, but I don’t think I quite got it right until the final performance (even the dress rehearsal, one week prior, was fairly rocky in this regard). And even then there were still a few problems, like the energy drop from Son of Man to Uplift and the energy drop from Singularity to Five Thousand Years (making Five Thousand Years a rather anticlimactic finale).</p><h2 id=\"MCing_\">MCing&nbsp;</h2><p>The previous Solstices I had attended were just a series of pieces strung together, and the audience were mostly left to discern the arc on their own. At some point in my research, I saw a video clip of Kenzi MCing a Solstice, and I immediately decided I wanted to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>In my opinion, there are a ton of advantages to having an MC. Here are a couple:</p><ol><li>It gives the audience more insight into why each piece was chosen and generally gives you a chance to tie the arc together more explicitly.</li><li>It allows you to make announcements during the program without breaking immersion, such as giving trigger warnings or asking the audience to hold their applause until further notice.</li><li>It fills what would otherwise be awkward pauses between pieces as performers get on and off the stage.</li></ol><h1 id=\"Post_performance_feedback\">Post-performance feedback</h1><p>About 50 people filled out the feedback survey, and their feedback falls into a few rough categories for me:</p><ol><li>“This person is right and I would change/tweak this if I had it to do over”</li><li>“This feedback should not be acted upon”</li><li>“Feedback on this is very split, and you can’t win ‘em all”</li></ol><h2 id=\"Things_I_would_tweak\">Things I would tweak</h2><p><strong id=\"Finale\">Finale</strong></p><p>The peak-end rule is really important, and my Solstice didn’t have a very strong ending. I had to go up onstage and be like, “Okay, now it’s over.” If I had it to do over, I might cut Five Thousand Years and end on Singularity, which everyone loved.</p><p><strong id=\"Moment_of_darkness\">Moment of darkness</strong></p><p>The moment of darkness itself (two minutes of silence in the pitch black) got mixed reviews - some people found it very powerful, some people found it existentially horrifying and had to distract themselves, and a lot of people found it didn’t really land. The main thing I would change here is the way I introduced it.</p><p>I said, “We’re about to sit in silence for two minutes. If you’re up for it, I want you to look up at the stars, and think of someone you’ve lost. Someone whose voice you will never hear again, whose mind is gone from the world forever. Give them your grief, yes, but also give them your resolve.”</p><p>In retrospect, this was far too specific an ask. A lot of people said that the moment of darkness didn’t really land specifically because they’d never lost anyone close to them. (I copied the text from the Solstice Habryka and I ran in Madison, where it worked very well, but where the circumstances were very different in quite a number of significant ways.) If I had it to do over, I would encourage people to sit with their feelings, wherever they were at, rather than prescribing something for them to think about.&nbsp;</p><p><strong id=\"First_speech\">First speech</strong></p><p>I struggled for a long time to find or write an appropriate speech for the first-speech slot in the program. It was only a day or so before the dress rehearsal that I settled on giving an abridged version of Nate’s This Is A Dawn. While it had roughly the right message, I don’t think I myself was that bought into it, and as a result, people seemed to find it a bit generic, and not really meaningful. I’m not actually sure what in particular I would do here if I had a do-over, but I do want to highlight that the first-speech slot is quite important and I definitely didn’t totally nail it.</p><h2 id=\"Feedback_that_should_not_be_acted_upon\">Feedback that should not be acted upon</h2><p>A hopefully uncontroversial example of this is the person who doesn’t like the sound of strummed instruments, and therefore gave a low rating to every song with strummed guitars. Sure, this is a valid way to feel, but at the same time, one person’s preference in this area does not mean it makes sense to cut all guitars from Solstice.</p><p>A more controversial example, but one that I am still willing to stand by publicly, is the common complaint that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiBaBca7-rY\"><u>Son of Man</u></a> is sexist. Look, I’m a woman. Chelsea is a woman. The person who soloed on Son of Man is a woman. My sense is that, while some people were genuinely offended, and that came through in their feedback, most of the people who registered complaints were just people who were worried that other people might have been offended. I continue to think this song is an excellent fit for Solstice message-wise and has great energy (it was intended to be performed a bit faster but there were some technical difficulties with the drums). I would not hesitate to include it again.</p><h1 id=\"Triggering_content\">Triggering content</h1><h2 id=\"Eating_disorder_trigger\">Eating disorder trigger</h2><p>For complicated reasons, there was a brief discussion of weight loss at the end of Solstice. It was intended as a sort of light-hearted post-credits piece, but we mishandled it, and people didn’t end up getting the chance to leave if the topic was difficult for them. This had significant negative consequences for some people, and I sincerely apologize for that.</p><p>We’re taking steps to make sure that future Bay Solstices are more careful around sensitive topics like this. Specific action items include providing verbal trigger warnings in addition to the ones written in the program, and allowing significantly more time for people to leave if they need to, including having some people planted in the audience to stand up and leave so that it feels socially okay to do so. (Even though I myself won’t be running Solstice next year, I’m in close contact with next year’s organizers and have made at least one of them aware of this.)</p><h2 id=\"Other_triggers\">Other triggers</h2><p>On the feedback form, some people mentioned being very upset by Solstice because it reminded them that they were lonely or felt like they could be accomplishing more. I do not think anything should change about Solstice itself in response to this feedback, because being reminded that the universe is vast and dark and cold is pretty much the entire point of Solstice.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps in the future it would be good to make it clear to potential Solstice-goers that Solstice deals a lot with death, individual responsibility, and the vast, uncaring universe. Then they can make more of an informed choice about whether or not to go, and if they can’t handle it, they can’t reasonably blame it on anyone but themselves.</p><h2 id=\"Individual_pieces\">Individual pieces</h2><p><strong id=\"Raw_feedback\">Raw feedback</strong></p><p>(The table below has the pieces in chronological order of how they appeared in the performance.)</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Hated</strong></td><td><strong>Dislike</strong></td><td><strong>Meh</strong></td><td><strong>Like</strong></td><td><strong>Love</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Circle</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The X days of X-Risk</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>To Drive the Cold Winter Away</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Bold Orion</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Time Wrote the Rocks</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>This is a Dawn (abridged)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Hard Times Come Again No More</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>There Will Come Soft Rain</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Pale Blue Dot</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Stardust</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Do You Realize</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>A Bottomless Pit of Suffering</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Bitter Wind Lullaby</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>16</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Eulogy</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The Moment of Darkness</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Spoken Call/Response</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>We Are the Light</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Light Pollution</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Endless Lights</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Brighter Than Today</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>How We Will Be Measured</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Son of Man</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Uplift</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>What it means to win</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Beautiful Tomorrow</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Singularity</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Five Thousand Years</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>After-the-Credits-Eliezer-Bit</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>14</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>At a high level, most people liked most things! This is heartening.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray and I sorted the pieces four different ways*, and there were five pieces that clearly came out on top and five that (only a little bit less) clearly came out at the bottom.</p><p>Best-liked:</p><ol><li>Eulogy</li><li>Singularity</li><li>Pale Blue Dot</li><li>Brighter Than Today</li><li>Bold Orion</li></ol><p>Worst-liked:</p><ol><li>After-the-Credits Eliezer bit</li><li>Son of Man</li><li>There Will Come Soft Rain</li><li>We Are the Light</li><li>Light Pollution</li></ol><p><strong id=\"Effect_of_delivery\">Effect of delivery</strong></p><p>Something I notice that’s interesting (but not that surprising) is the large effect that delivery had on people’s ratings. For example, two of the highest rated pieces were Singularity and Pale Blue Dot. In addition to a solid delivery by Chelsea, Pale Blue Dot had a backing track and custom planetarium footage. Singularity was extremely energetic and fun, and people had generally positive affect towards all of the songs that prominently featured Taylor because he’s such an obviously skilled musician. Brighter Than Today and Bold Orion were also energetic and very polished performances.</p><p>By contrast, people were relatively lukewarm on Endless Lights and Bitter Wind Lullaby, two Solstice staples that I think of as being fairly well-liked in general. Both of these songs had significant problems with their execution, with the performers having trouble agreeing on the time signature. As a result, it was difficult for people to sing along, which seems to have made for a negative overall impression.</p><p><strong id=\"Addressing_the_elephant_in_the_room\">Addressing the elephant in the room</strong></p><p>An additional thing that people who attended this Solstice might want to see addressed is what the heck was up with the Eliezer piece. Even apart from those who found it triggering or otherwise inappropriate, a lot of people were just confused about why it happened (e.g., several people's reaction was, \"Why is this guy talking to me like I'm his friend, I don't even know him\"). The explanation is perhaps not all that satisfying, but I'll give it anyway.</p><p>In early October, Eliezer contacted me asking if he could do a shenanigan at Solstice. He explained his idea to me, and while I didn't really see how it would fit in, I also didn't want to reject him out of hand.</p><p>I talked to a couple people I trusted about this, and we came to the conclusion that it would be pretty valuable to have Eliezer onstage. The reasons for this were a bit nebulous, but roughly rested on the following:</p><ul><li>Regardless of any single community member's personal feelings on him and his writings, it's hard to deny that this community would not exist as it does today without Eliezer. (I, for example, came in through a chance encounter with HPMOR in high school, and basically every aspect of my current life is a direct result of that encounter.)</li><li>Eliezer has increasingly retreated from public life over the past few years, and this has resulted in some feelings of abandonment on the part of the community.</li><li>Having Eliezer onstage during Solstice would show his implicit support for the community and the event; following the above, it would remind the audience of what brought us all together and that we haven't been abandoned by our founders.</li></ul><p>Based on this reasoning, it was having Eliezer onstage that mattered, and the content of his piece wasn't really relevant. The eating disorder trigger was honestly not something I even considered until someone mentioned it after the dress rehearsal. It was at that point that I decided to move the piece to be 'post-credits' (it had previously been early in the program proper), to make it opt-out for people uncomfortable with the topic, but as mentioned above, I failed to handle this correctly.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that, while more people hated the Eliezer bit than hated any other piece, there were also a fair number of people who loved it (if you sort by the raw number of Loves, it comes dead middle). So it was in fact not universally reviled (lots of people found it hilarious or heartwarming); it was just very polarizing.</p><h1 id=\"Summary_of_takeaways\">Summary of takeaways</h1><p>This is just all of the takeaways from the main body of this post, in the order that they appeared.</p><ul><li>Starting a year in advance and testing and iterating often makes for a really good final product but also burns you out like hell. I think this was ultimately definitely worth it, but if I was told I had to do another year of this I would probably flee the country.</li><li>Deciding on a central theme/thesis for your Solstice early on is really important.</li><li>Set a regular time to work on Solstice things so that they don’t slip through the cracks, especially if you have a full-time job. It’s best if you can meet with other people regularly for this purpose, because accountability.</li><li>While hiring professional musicians may be easier, there are enough skilled musicians in the Bay Area rationalist community that I think it’s worthwhile to go that route, especially since this makes it feel more like a community event. Just make sure that people audition (or are known to be skilled and easy to work with) and can commit to rehearsing with each other.</li><li>Choose speakers and other performers largely based on their skill level, but it’s also important to make sure that they’re value-aligned with you when it comes to the Solstice you’re creating together.</li><li>It’s okay to iterate on the content until the very last minute so long as everyone is on the same page / no one is thrown off or blind-sided by the late changes.</li><li>If you want your arc to be really cohesive, you need to exert centralized control over each piece rather than just leaving performers to do their own thing.</li><li>It’s really hard to create a smooth arc over all the dimensions that matter. If you can write your own songs or work with a friend who can write original songs, this is a huge asset.</li><li>MCing is great.</li><li>Not all feedback should be acted upon.</li><li>Pay attention to the peak-end rule.</li><li>Potentially triggering topics should be handled more carefully than they were by me. It’s important for people to have a genuine opportunity to make an informed choice about what they’re exposed to.</li><li>Delivery/execution of pieces is just as important as (if not more important than) the semantic content and the fit in the arc.</li></ul><h1 id=\"Resources\">Resources</h1><h2 id=\"Setlist_spreadsheet\">Setlist spreadsheet</h2><p>I love spreadsheets with a passion, and I found keeping all of the relevant material in one place to be enormously helpful both for me and for communication purposes. (Whenever someone had a question about the arc, the performers, or anything, we could just pull up the spreadsheet, and even make a copy of it to see how changing the order of the pieces would feel.)</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T97fixXZx81aJ-zIBM5b7UnQpv4TflXGuauly29PlLI/\"><u>Here</u></a> is a template for the spreadsheet I used.

      "markdown": "I was the Creative Director for last year’s Winter Solstice in the Bay Area. I worked with Nat Kozak and Chelsea Voss, who were both focused more on logistics. Chelsea was also the official leader who oversaw both me and Nat and had final say on disputes. (However, I was granted dictatorial control over the Solstice arc and had final say in that arena.) I legit have no idea how any one of us would have pulled this off without the others; love to both of them and also massive respect to Cody Wild, who somehow ran the entire thing herself in 2018.\n\nWhile I worked with a bunch of other people on Solstice, all opinions expressed here are my own. \n\nProcess\n=======\n\nBeginnings & research phase\n---------------------------\n\nChelsea, Nat, and I spent just about a full year preparing for Solstice. Our first meeting as a group was on January 20th, and we received official confirmation that we’d be in charge about a month later. In the following month, the three of us had roughly weekly planning meetings via video chat. In the first meeting, we set goals for what we wanted to have done by the first of April, and after that we checked in regularly for a while.\n\nMy goal by the first of April was to have a rough outline of the entire arc and a plan for how to make the tone be coherent. I also wanted to get a better handle on the task, and to that end I had conversations with several previous Solstice organizers and also read as much as I could. This included Ray’s sequence on ritual, most of the writing on the Secular Solstice website (both the [blog](http://secularsolstice.com/blog/) and the [resources](https://secularsolstice.com/resources/) section were useful), discussions on the Rational Ritual Facebook group, and whatever else I could find. \n\nI also spent a full day listening to every single song that had ever been recommended for Solstice (see below) and making notes on them in a spreadsheet. When I ran out of songs in that reference class, I sorted my iTunes library by most listens and started going through to see if any of those songs might fit. This was quite surprisingly fruitful - I actually ended up using three of the songs that were originally put on my list in this way.\n\nAnother thing I did was go around and ask people what they wanted out of Solstice. I got responses that were actually fairly useful, like “I lose interest during long speeches” and “there should be more singalongs” and “I like singalongs but a lot of the songs have really complicated tunes and I can’t handle it.”\n\nI think even with all that research and preparation, I still didn’t have a very good sense of the history of Solstice. I had only been to two big Bay Area Solstices, plus a private Solstice in the woods, plus a short, small, off-the-cuff Solstice that Habryka and I ran at my mom’s house in 2018. I wasn’t around for early Solstices, and I’d never seen what they were like in Boston, Seattle, or New York. \n\nCreating the setlist\n--------------------\n\n**The first setlist**\n\nI met the April 1st deadline for having an outline of the entire arc. I drew up my first setlist in my notebook on a five-hour plane ride. I was taking into consideration more small snippets of advice than I can list here, but I can quote the guiding goal I referred to throughout the entirety of my time working on this Solstice:\n\n> I want my Solstice to be about the brokenness of the world and the ethos of \"somebody has to and no one else will\", but also the fact that even if you exercise your individual agency to do the most you can, we still might fail. \n\nBelow are some sample pages from my notebook, with most names redacted. Note that I didn't ask any of these people before assigning them to songs; this was just idle speculation on a plane ride about who might be able to pull off each song.\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/0f1d9fb4ad2b3c537daee04aaf93097ead1e15460e3a83a0.jpg)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/dda8bb26adcd597c0fa0179abdb802e2c120c2260b512048.jpg)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/c012fd1430c809a35b35b17bb95737265e4deb6ae74e5cb7.jpg)\n\n![](https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/9b831b5a103ffaac0de253a3c9194bd8f11e3e31feaebd28.jpg)\n\nSome sample pages from my notebook\n\nAfter that was a process of constant iteration. \n\n**Run-throughs**\n\nWe had our first full run-through of the setlist on June 16th. In the two months leading up to this, Chelsea checked in with me weekly. I had a lot of speeches to write and planned to write one and send it to her each week (which I more or less accomplished). I found this accountability mechanism quite helpful.\n\nThe first run-through was just me, Habryka, and Chelsea. We sat on the floor of my bedroom, played recordings of the songs to sing along with, and took turns reading the speeches. For this run-through, I wrote three new speeches, re-used two existing Solstice speeches, and threw in Pale Blue Dot, an abridged version of the poem [Ring Out, Wild Bells](https://poets.org/poem/memoriam-ring-out-wild-bells), and the Sequences post [On Doing The Impossible](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fpecAJLG9czABgCe9/on-doing-the-impossible). After the run-through, which took about two hours (we timed each piece), the three of us debriefed, and I used the extensive notes I took to make changes to the setlist.\n\nI felt burned out after this and had the luxury of taking all of July off from Solstice work. This was a huge benefit of starting so early.\n\nThe next run-through was in September, scheduled around the dates when our featured musician, Taylor (who lives in Vermont) would be in town. This was significantly more involved but still fairly informal. Seven people participated in total (including Ray, who was experimenting with projection), we provided our own instrumentation for most of the songs, and most of the speeches were read by the people who would eventually give them. Afterwards, each person individually gave me feedback, and again, I made significant changes to the setlist in response.\n\nRegular coworking hours\n-----------------------\n\nAround the time of the September run-through, things really picked up. Going into crunch time, Chelsea, Nat, and I set up a regular time for Solstice coworking. We met for a couple hours every Monday night - that served both as our designated time to work on Solstice things (since we all also have day jobs) and an opportunity for in-person communication about high-context or sensitive topics.\n\nChoosing performers\n-------------------\n\n**Skill level**\n\nWe put out a [call for auditions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/193wc6UEsvfm-_tQGKZRkCWU6yrb5XU6CGhA1pt2xpdk/edit) in August, but we didn’t publicize it very well, so we didn’t receive many applications. I required auditions for speakers and singalong vocalists, but not for instrumentalists - in retrospect, this was an obvious mistake. I let almost all of the instrumentalists who applied participate in as many songs as they wanted, but there were issues with everything from not having time to rehearse to not being able to play in the key the vocalist wanted to disagreements on chords and time signatures. \n\nSince we didn’t get enough applications to fill all the slots, I reached out to people who I already knew were competent from seeing them perform in previous Solstices or in other contexts (such as at jam sessions or in the REACH Musical Revue). This ended up working quite well - I think that everyone I chose in this way gave a good performance.\n\nNYC has often hired professional musicians, rather than having community members provide the instrumentation - a possibility I knew about but never seriously considered. While I still wouldn’t pay for professional musicians, I’ve come to understand better why someone might decide to do so, after experiencing the difficulties (mentioned above) of getting amateur musicians to produce a performance-ready piece.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of the amateurs did do an excellent job! So I think the takeaway here is just that it’s important to have people audition (or be very sure of their competence level in some other way) and make sure they’re able to put in the time commitment to rehearse.\n\n**Orientation towards Solstice as a whole**\n\nSomething I struggled with a fair amount was disagreements about arc cohesion vs showcasing technical skill. Arc cohesion trumped all other concerns for me, with singalongability a close second. However, it’s often the case that when singers are given the chance to perform, they want to do something more interesting than just lead the melody of a singalong, so I was sometimes at loggerheads with performers who wanted to do more complex pieces or include intricate harmonies. There are some pieces for which I regret not being firmer about putting my foot down on this issue, and I think that ultimately it’s probably reasonable to exclude performers on this basis if you can’t come to an agreement.\n\nOn the flip side, I was extremely grateful to the people whose pieces I cut after the dress rehearsal, a week before the performance. I apologized to all of them and gave them the opportunity to contest the decision, but they were all really great about it and said things along the lines of “I care way more about Solstice being better than I do about cashing out on the work I did.” To those people - I really appreciate you, and thank you for being wonderful!\n\nFinal preparations\n------------------\n\nIn late November we did a walk-through of the venue (important for testing planetarium footage and lighting options), then in early December we had a tech rehearsal at the planetarium (mostly for A/V) and a dress rehearsal (not at the planetarium). Much of the benefit here was logistical, and I won’t touch on that too much since it’s not my wheelhouse, but it also gave me a chance to see what the final product would be like. I was originally supposed to stop editing the setlist entirely on November 5th, but in reality, I made several changes to the order and even cut some pieces in response to the dress rehearsal, and the exact content of some things was kind of up in the air even on the day of. While I technically missed my deadline or whatever, I don’t regret that at all - I think my Solstice was quite significantly better than it would have been if I had stopped iterating on the setlist a month earlier.\n\nConsiderations for creating a setlist\n=====================================\n\nCreating a cohesive message\n---------------------------\n\nWhen it came to speeches, I took an arc-first approach. I decided what message fit in every place in the arc and found a piece that fit there. Only after that did I approach potential speakers. I ended up using four existing pieces wholesale; the rest were based on existing pieces but were either remixed or heavily edited by the speaker. The takeaway action item here is to have something very specific in mind for each speech and conveying that to the speaker. This improves cohesion while still allowing each speaker to put their own twist on the piece if they so choose.\n\nExamples:\n\n*   Tessa remixed Ray’s *A Bottomless Pit of Suffering* to make more sense in Berkeley (it was originally given in NYC, where it’s very cold) and to have more of her own voice.\n*   I had Nate Soares on the docket from quite early on in the process, but he’s busy executive-directing MIRI so I didn’t want to take up too much of his time. With his input, I chose an old post from his blog for him to read ([*How We Will Be Measured*](http://mindingourway.com/how-we-will-be-measured/)), and Chelsea and I edited it to be shorter and more appropriate as a speech. Nate then made a bunch of his own changes to reflect the ways his thinking has changed over the past few years, but ultimately it was still recognizable as the same piece.\n*   Though it ended up being cut at the very last minute, Alex Altair adapted a scene from HPMoR into a speech, which was pretty cool.\n\nCreating a smooth arc\n---------------------\n\nIn order to create a smooth experience, you have to make sure that there are smooth transitions  between the message, emotional tone, and musical/artistic feel of each piece and the next. It turns out to be really hard to match these all up. For example, there are some funny/upbeat/light-hearted songs about death (e.g. *We Will All Go Together When We Go*), and some fairly serious-sounding songs about more light-hearted topics (e.g. *Time Wrote the Rocks*). Some songs are up-tempo, some are slow and mournful, some have percussion, some are performed by choir. There are just a ton of considerations. (This is why Ray writes so many of his own songs - that’s the only way you can really have control over the message, tone, and feel all at once.)\n\nI was aware of all of these considerations, and that’s a big part of the reason that I made sure to run through each version of the setlist from start to finish, but I don’t think I quite got it right until the final performance (even the dress rehearsal, one week prior, was fairly rocky in this regard). And even then there were still a few problems, like the energy drop from Son of Man to Uplift and the energy drop from Singularity to Five Thousand Years (making Five Thousand Years a rather anticlimactic finale).\n\nMCing \n------\n\nThe previous Solstices I had attended were just a series of pieces strung together, and the audience were mostly left to discern the arc on their own. At some point in my research, I saw a video clip of Kenzi MCing a Solstice, and I immediately decided I wanted to do that. \n\nIn my opinion, there are a ton of advantages to having an MC. Here are a couple:\n\n1.  It gives the audience more insight into why each piece was chosen and generally gives you a chance to tie the arc together more explicitly.\n2.  It allows you to make announcements during the program without breaking immersion, such as giving trigger warnings or asking the audience to hold their applause until further notice.\n3.  It fills what would otherwise be awkward pauses between pieces as performers get on and off the stage.\n\nPost-performance feedback\n=========================\n\nAbout 50 people filled out the feedback survey, and their feedback falls into a few rough categories for me:\n\n1.  “This person is right and I would change/tweak this if I had it to do over”\n2.  “This feedback should not be acted upon”\n3.  “Feedback on this is very split, and you can’t win ‘em all”\n\nThings I would tweak\n--------------------\n\n**Finale**\n\nThe peak-end rule is really important, and my Solstice didn’t have a very strong ending. I had to go up onstage and be like, “Okay, now it’s over.” If I had it to do over, I might cut Five Thousand Years and end on Singularity, which everyone loved.\n\n**Moment of darkness**\n\nThe moment of darkness itself (two minutes of silence in the pitch black) got mixed reviews - some people found it very powerful, some people found it existentially horrifying and had to distract themselves, and a lot of people found it didn’t really land. The main thing I would change here is the way I introduced it.\n\nI said, “We’re about to sit in silence for two minutes. If you’re up for it, I want you to look up at the stars, and think of someone you’ve lost. Someone whose voice you will never hear again, whose mind is gone from the world forever. Give them your grief, yes, but also give them your resolve.”\n\nIn retrospect, this was far too specific an ask. A lot of people said that the moment of darkness didn’t really land specifically because they’d never lost anyone close to them. (I copied the text from the Solstice Habryka and I ran in Madison, where it worked very well, but where the circumstances were very different in quite a number of significant ways.) If I had it to do over, I would encourage people to sit with their feelings, wherever they were at, rather than prescribing something for them to think about. \n\n**First speech**\n\nI struggled for a long time to find or write an appropriate speech for the first-speech slot in the program. It was only a day or so before the dress rehearsal that I settled on giving an abridged version of Nate’s This Is A Dawn. While it had roughly the right message, I don’t think I myself was that bought into it, and as a result, people seemed to find it a bit generic, and not really meaningful. I’m not actually sure what in particular I would do here if I had a do-over, but I do want to highlight that the first-speech slot is quite important and I definitely didn’t totally nail it.\n\nFeedback that should not be acted upon\n--------------------------------------\n\nA hopefully uncontroversial example of this is the person who doesn’t like the sound of strummed instruments, and therefore gave a low rating to every song with strummed guitars. Sure, this is a valid way to feel, but at the same time, one person’s preference in this area does not mean it makes sense to cut all guitars from Solstice.\n\nA more controversial example, but one that I am still willing to stand by publicly, is the common complaint that [Son of Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiBaBca7-rY) is sexist. Look, I’m a woman. Chelsea is a woman. The person who soloed on Son of Man is a woman. My sense is that, while some people were genuinely offended, and that came through in their feedback, most of the people who registered complaints were just people who were worried that other people might have been offended. I continue to think this song is an excellent fit for Solstice message-wise and has great energy (it was intended to be performed a bit faster but there were some technical difficulties with the drums). I would not hesitate to include it again.\n\nTriggering content\n==================\n\nEating disorder trigger\n-----------------------\n\nFor complicated reasons, there was a brief discussion of weight loss at the end of Solstice. It was intended as a sort of light-hearted post-credits piece, but we mishandled it, and people didn’t end up getting the chance to leave if the topic was difficult for them. This had significant negative consequences for some people, and I sincerely apologize for that.\n\nWe’re taking steps to make sure that future Bay Solstices are more careful around sensitive topics like this. Specific action items include providing verbal trigger warnings in addition to the ones written in the program, and allowing significantly more time for people to leave if they need to, including having some people planted in the audience to stand up and leave so that it feels socially okay to do so. (Even though I myself won’t be running Solstice next year, I’m in close contact with next year’s organizers and have made at least one of them aware of this.)\n\nOther triggers\n--------------\n\nOn the feedback form, some people mentioned being very upset by Solstice because it reminded them that they were lonely or felt like they could be accomplishing more. I do not think anything should change about Solstice itself in response to this feedback, because being reminded that the universe is vast and dark and cold is pretty much the entire point of Solstice. \n\nPerhaps in the future it would be good to make it clear to potential Solstice-goers that Solstice deals a lot with death, individual responsibility, and the vast, uncaring universe. Then they can make more of an informed choice about whether or not to go, and if they can’t handle it, they can’t reasonably blame it on anyone but themselves.\n\nIndividual pieces\n-----------------\n\n**Raw feedback**\n\n(The table below has the pieces in chronological order of how they appeared in the performance.)\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Hated</strong></td><td><strong>Dislike</strong></td><td><strong>Meh</strong></td><td><strong>Like</strong></td><td><strong>Love</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Circle</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The X days of X-Risk</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>To Drive the Cold Winter Away</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Bold Orion</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>20</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Time Wrote the Rocks</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>17</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>This is a Dawn (abridged)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Hard Times Come Again No More</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>18</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>There Will Come Soft Rain</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Pale Blue Dot</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>12</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Stardust</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>13</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Do You Realize</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>A Bottomless Pit of Suffering</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Bitter Wind Lullaby</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>16</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Eulogy</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>The Moment of Darkness</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Spoken Call/Response</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>We Are the Light</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>13</td><td>16</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Light Pollution</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>19</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Endless Lights</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>11</td><td>14</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Brighter Than Today</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>How We Will Be Measured</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>15</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Son of Man</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>15</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Uplift</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>15</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>What it means to win</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>20</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>Beautiful Tomorrow</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>Singularity</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>Five Thousand Years</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>After-the-Credits-Eliezer-Bit</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>14</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nAt a high level, most people liked most things! This is heartening. \n\nRay and I sorted the pieces four different ways*, and there were five pieces that clearly came out on top and five that (only a little bit less) clearly came out at the bottom.\n\nBest-liked:\n\n1.  Eulogy\n2.  Singularity\n3.  Pale Blue Dot\n4.  Brighter Than Today\n5.  Bold Orion\n\nWorst-liked:\n\n1.  After-the-Credits Eliezer bit\n2.  Son of Man\n3.  There Will Come Soft Rain\n4.  We Are the Light\n5.  Light Pollution\n\n**Effect of delivery**\n\nSomething I notice that’s interesting (but not that surprising) is the large effect that delivery had on people’s ratings. For example, two of the highest rated pieces were Singularity and Pale Blue Dot. In addition to a solid delivery by Chelsea, Pale Blue Dot had a backing track and custom planetarium footage. Singularity was extremely energetic and fun, and people had generally positive affect towards all of the songs that prominently featured Taylor because he’s such an obviously skilled musician. Brighter Than Today and Bold Orion were also energetic and very polished performances.\n\nBy contrast, people were relatively lukewarm on Endless Lights and Bitter Wind Lullaby, two Solstice staples that I think of as being fairly well-liked in general. Both of these songs had significant problems with their execution, with the performers having trouble agreeing on the time signature. As a result, it was difficult for people to sing along, which seems to have made for a negative overall impression.\n\n**Addressing the elephant in the room**\n\nAn additional thing that people who attended this Solstice might want to see addressed is what the heck was up with the Eliezer piece. Even apart from those who found it triggering or otherwise inappropriate, a lot of people were just confused about why it happened (e.g., several people's reaction was, \"Why is this guy talking to me like I'm his friend, I don't even know him\"). The explanation is perhaps not all that satisfying, but I'll give it anyway.\n\nIn early October, Eliezer contacted me asking if he could do a shenanigan at Solstice. He explained his idea to me, and while I didn't really see how it would fit in, I also didn't want to reject him out of hand.\n\nI talked to a couple people I trusted about this, and we came to the conclusion that it would be pretty valuable to have Eliezer onstage. The reasons for this were a bit nebulous, but roughly rested on the following:\n\n*   Regardless of any single community member's personal feelings on him and his writings, it's hard to deny that this community would not exist as it does today without Eliezer. (I, for example, came in through a chance encounter with HPMOR in high school, and basically every aspect of my current life is a direct result of that encounter.)\n*   Eliezer has increasingly retreated from public life over the past few years, and this has resulted in some feelings of abandonment on the part of the community.\n*   Having Eliezer onstage during Solstice would show his implicit support for the community and the event; following the above, it would remind the audience of what brought us all together and that we haven't been abandoned by our founders.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it was having Eliezer onstage that mattered, and the content of his piece wasn't really relevant. The eating disorder trigger was honestly not something I even considered until someone mentioned it after the dress rehearsal. It was at that point that I decided to move the piece to be 'post-credits' (it had previously been early in the program proper), to make it opt-out for people uncomfortable with the topic, but as mentioned above, I failed to handle this correctly.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that, while more people hated the Eliezer bit than hated any other piece, there were also a fair number of people who loved it (if you sort by the raw number of Loves, it comes dead middle). So it was in fact not universally reviled (lots of people found it hilarious or heartwarming); it was just very polarizing.\n\nSummary of takeaways\n====================\n\nThis is just all of the takeaways from the main body of this post, in the order that they appeared.\n\n*   Starting a year in advance and testing and iterating often makes for a really good final product but also burns you out like hell. I think this was ultimately definitely worth it, but if I was told I had to do another year of this I would probably flee the country.\n*   Deciding on a central theme/thesis for your Solstice early on is really important.\n*   Set a regular time to work on Solstice things so that they don’t slip through the cracks, especially if you have a full-time job. It’s best if you can meet with other people regularly for this purpose, because accountability.\n*   While hiring professional musicians may be easier, there are enough skilled musicians in the Bay Area rationalist community that I think it’s worthwhile to go that route, especially since this makes it feel more like a community event. Just make sure that people audition (or are known to be skilled and easy to work with) and can commit to rehearsing with each other.\n*   Choose speakers and other performers largely based on their skill level, but it’s also important to make sure that they’re value-aligned with you when it comes to the Solstice you’re creating together.\n*   It’s okay to iterate on the content until the very last minute so long as everyone is on the same page / no one is thrown off or blind-sided by the late changes.\n*   If you want your arc to be really cohesive, you need to exert centralized control over each piece rather than just leaving performers to do their own thing.\n*   It’s really hard to create a smooth arc over all the dimensions that matter. If you can write your own songs or work with a friend who can write original songs, this is a huge asset.\n*   MCing is great.\n*   Not all feedback should be acted upon.\n*   Pay attention to the peak-end rule.\n*   Potentially triggering topics should be handled more carefully than they were by me. It’s important for people to have a genuine opportunity to make an informed choice about what they’re exposed to.\n*   Delivery/execution of pieces is just as important as (if not more important than) the semantic content and the fit in the arc.\n\nResources\n=========\n\nSetlist spreadsheet\n-------------------\n\nI love spreadsheets with a passion, and I found keeping all of the relevant material in one place to be enormously helpful both for me and for communication purposes. (Whenever someone had a question about the arc, the performers, or anything, we could just pull up the spreadsheet, and even make a copy of it to see how changing the order of the pieces would feel.)\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T97fixXZx81aJ-zIBM5b7UnQpv4TflXGuauly29PlLI/) is a template for the spreadsheet I used. Let me know if anything is unclear!\n\nMasterlist of Solstice materials\n--------------------------------\n\nDaniel Speyer runs the [Secular Solstice GitHub page](https://secularsolstice.github.io/), which is a useful resource, but it’s also very hard to edit - especially if, like me, you’re not a programmer and don’t know how to use GitHub in general. The [Giant Epic Rationalist Solstice Filk spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ETa5RXtDJAQsk6RYhaITfMj1ktOZLP2AKwmcFE8iTVY/edit#gid=0) is likewise a useful resource, but it’s kind of a mess. So I made [my own spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QhguW6PHdAkYKClsk0ZiAnmWbgs0_SLYw4dkoQosUo/), which is publicly editable and incorporates every song, poem, story, and speech from the above two repositories. (Apologies to Daniel Speyer and to anyone who sees this as polluting the commons by instantiating too many competing projects.)\n\n* * *\n\n\\* The sorting algorithms we used were the following:\n\n1.  % Positive : (Liked + Loved) / (Total responses)\n2.

E. van Vogt's _Null-A_ novels, starting with _The World of Null-A._  Now let it first be admitted that Van Vogt had a number of flaws as an author.  With that said, it is probably a historical fact about my causal origins, that the _Null-A_ books had an impact on my mind that I didn't even realize until years later.  It's not the sort of book that I read over and over again, I read it and then put it down, but -\n\n\\- but this is where I was first exposed to such concepts as \"The map is not the territory\" and \"rose~1~ is not rose~2~\".\n\nNull-A stands for \"Non-Aristotelian\", and the premise of the ficton is that studying Korzybski's General Semantics makes you a superhero.  Let's not really go into that part.  But in the Null-A ficton:\n\n1)  The protagonist, Gilbert Gosseyn, is not a mutant.  He has _studied_ rationality techniques that have been _systematized_ and are used by other members of his society, not just him.\n\n2)  Van Vogt tells us what (some of) these principles are, rather than leaving them mysteriously blank - we can't be Gilbert Gosseyn, but we can at least use _some_ of this stuff.\n\n3)  Van Vogt [conveys the experience](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/truth-from-fiction.html), _shows_ Gosseyn in action using the principles, rather than leaving them to triumphant explanation afterward.  We are put into Gosseyn's shoes at the moment of his e.g. making a conscious distinction between two different things referred to by the same name.\n\nThis is a high standard to meet.\n\nBut Marc Stiegler's _David's Sling_ (quoted in e.g. [this post](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/gray-fallacy.html)) meets this same standard:  The Zetetics derive their abilities from training in a systematized tradition; we get to see the actual principles the Zetetics are using, and they're ones we could try to apply in real life; and we're put into their shoes at the moments of their use.\n\nI mention this to show that it isn't _only_ van Vogt who's ever done this.\n\nHowever...\n\n...those two examples actually _exhaust_ my knowledge of the science fiction and fantasy literature, so far as I can remember.\n\nIt really is a very high standard we're setting here.  To realistically show your characters using an interesting technique of rationality, you have to _know_ an interesting technique of rationality.  Van Vogt was inspired by Korzybski, who - I discovered when I looked this up, just now - actually _invented_ the phrase \"The map is not the territory\".  Marc Stiegler was inspired by, among other sources, Eric Drexler and Robin Hanson.  (Stiegler has another novel called _Earthweb_ about using prediction markets to defend the Earth from invading aliens, which was my introduction to the concept of prediction markets.)\n\nIf I relax the standard to focus mainly on item (3), fiction that transmits a powerful experience of using rationality, then I could add in Greg Egan's _Distress,_ some of [Lawrence Watt-Evans](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/07/lawrence-watt-e.html)'s strange little novels, the travails of Salvor Hardin in the first _Foundation_ novel, and probably any number of others.\n\nBut what I'm really interested in is whether there's any full-blown Rationalist Fiction that I've missed - or maybe just haven't remembered.  Failing that, I'm interested in stories that merely do a good job of conveying a rationalist experience.  (Please specify which of these cases is true, if you make a recommendation.)"

I thank Ruby Bloom for suggesting that I share the post here as well.</p><h1 id=\"OpenAI_Scholars__Fifth_Steps___The_Dreaded_Literature_Review\"><strong>OpenAI Scholars: Fifth Steps - The Dreaded Literature Review</strong></h1><p>The <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-spring-2020/\">OpenAI Scholars</a> , and I among them, recently completed a project proposal for the second half of our program. Having recently finished a PhD, writing a proposal and doing the requisite literature review, should be second nature. But literature reviews were always my least favorite part of research.<br></p><p>Fortunately, I'm in good company. In a previous life as a young aspiring neuroscientist, I once attended a talk by <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1981/hubel/facts/\">David Hubel</a> . When asked for tips about how to \"keep up with the literature\", I recall that Professor Hubel responded: \"You know, at some point in your career, you have to decide if you want to be a consumer - or a producer.\" He elaborated that he would only really look at papers that his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kuffler\">advisor</a> or his long-term collaborator <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel\">Torsten Wiesel</a> pointed him to.</p><span><figure><img src=\"https://katarinaslama.github.io/images/hubel.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>There's good reason to want to avoid literature reviews. To begin with, the problem formulation is intractable: \"Know everything.\" If you've spent any amount of time around academics, it will soon become apparent that this is exactly what they expect from you. \"Oh you have<strong>n't</strong> read that paper?\" The assumption is that you have read every paper there is.<br></p><p>Of course, this is an impossible task. Last time I visited Google Scholar and searched on a few project-relevant terms, I encountered 105,000 papers. It takes me a full day to read and satisfactorily understand an academic paper. So reading 105 kilo-papers would take me 288 years. And I had hoped to also do some coding work during the Scholars program.<br></p><p>Now suppose you want to cook a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghormeh_sabzi\">ghormeh sabzi</a> . To do so, you buy yourself a can of <a href=\"https://www.sadaf.com/sadaf-herbs-mix-sabzi-ghormeh-14-1380\">ghormeh sabzi mix</a> , and follow the instructions on the can. There are about five steps. However, as ubiquitous an activity as the literature review is (in academic circles anyway), I am yet to encounter an honest and pragmatic recipe for how they are to be cooked. I really wish there was one.<br></p><p>I for one am a great fan of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh\">Thich Nhat Hanh's</a> how-to books. Some of my favorite titles among Nhat Hanh's books are: \"How to sit\", \"How to relax\", and - perhaps the best one - \"How to see\".<br></p><span><figure><img src=\"https://katarinaslama.github.io/images/howtosee.jpg\" class=\"draft-image center\" style=\"width:40%\"></figure></span><p>I wish there had been a series of books like that available for me as a beginning grad student, covering seemingly trivial but often intractable activities like \"How to read a paper\", \"How to attend a talk\" and, indeed, \"How to do a literature review\". </p><p>(**Updated: Apparently there exist plenty of expositions on this topic. See the comment by AllAmericanBreakfast below. I hope that some of the ideas in this post might nonetheless add something to whatever else you might have read.) </p><p>So, this is a first draft toward such a pragmatic guide to literature reviews: How to do them and how to avoid them. Again, this is absolutely in draft form, so please do send your constructive feedback my way.</p><h1 id=\"How_to_do_a_literature_review\"><strong>How to do a literature review</strong></h1><h2 id=\"1__Start_with_your_goal_\">1. Start with your goal.</h2><p>Do not start your literature review with the goal of \"doing a literature review\". Notice that such a goal does not have an end point when you can look at your work in satisfaction and notice that you are done. (Unless you have 288 years to spare). Instead, start with identifying your goal: Why are you doing this literature review? In my case, I had completed a spreadsheet with 50 papers, including their main points, type of neural recording, type of network architecture, a usefulness rating etc., by the time I realized that I had not identified my goal. I had to take a deliberate step back to recall that one goal of my literature review was to write a project proposal. Hence, my literature review should be tailored to that goal. Once I realized that, I decided to approach my work from the opposite direction: I drafted a project proposal \"blind\" to the literature. In other words, I wrote out a draft in bullet points with only the information I had in my mind. Once I had done that, it became quite obvious where I had knowledge gaps. Those knowledge gaps created the questions that I needed to search for in my literature review (see point 3 below.)<br></p><h2 id=\"2__Decide_what_constitutes_success__How_will_you_know_that_you_re_done_\">2. Decide what constitutes success: How will you know that you're done?</h2><p>This is really important, and it's often the hardest part with an infinity-project like a literature review. In my case, the done-point was when I had completed the project proposal. But how do I know that my proposal is good enough? In practice, for me, it was when the deadline hit. If you have come up with better metrics and markers for when to consider a project completed, please do let me know.<br></p><h2 id=\"3__Define_your_questions_\">3. Define your questions.</h2><p>When doing a literature review, it's critical to know what information you're searching for. Trying to absorb all the information contained in a dense document is rarely a good plan. In my case, my questions fell out of my first, naive project proposal draft. I also talked my project through with a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/home\">friend</a> , who is a more experienced researcher. He offered the following thought points for guidance to a literature review for a new project:<br></p><p>1. The goal for your literature review should be to identify the problem that your project will solve. Your project might either aim to solve a new problem, or improve on an existing method.<br>2. Use the literature revew to identify *gaps* in the literature: What do we not yet know?<br>3. What are the shortcomings of existing methods to solve the problem? Why are current approaches not yet useful in practice? What is the bottleneck?<br></p><h2 id=\"4__Answer_your_questions_\">4. Answer your questions.</h2><p>I think this is self-explanatory, but please let me know if not! One thing to keep in mind here is to not get lost in literature-tangents while finding answers to your questions. Provided your goal is to finish, that is. If you have the time to go off on philosophical tangents, feel free and enjoy!<br></p><h2 id=\"5__Stop_\">5. Stop.</h2><p>Just stop. Seriously. When you're done, you should stop. Go take a walk outside.<br></p><h1 id=\"How_to_avoid_doing_literature_reviews\"><strong>How to avoid doing literature reviews</strong></h1><p>The first section described the second-best way of doing a literature review. The best way to do a literature review is to not do a literature review. The art of avoiding doing a literature review is very similar to the art of avoiding deep cleaning your house: Keep it tidy on a daily basis. (Just like with deep cleaning your house, you probably still need to do a proper deep dive into the literature from time to time, just not as frequently as you would if you didn't have a routine of daily up-keep). Here are some ideas for \"keeping up with the literature\":<br></p><h2 id=\"1__Mind_whom_you_follow_on_Google_Scholar_\">1. Mind whom you follow on Google Scholar.</h2><p>Once you've gotten your feet a little bit wet in your field of interest, you will have a clue of who often writes interesting papers. If you follow them on Google Scholar, you will be notified as they publish more interesting stuff.<br></p><h2 id=\"2__Mind_whom_you_follow_on_Twitter_\">2. Mind whom you follow on Twitter.</h2><p>This is especially true of deep learning, but it's becoming increasingly common in every scientific field: Those same people that you follow on Google Scholar - they will also be tweeting when they publish new cool stuff. Also when their friends publish new cool stuff. They might even highlight the most interesting aspect of their work through a figure, or a digestible blog post. Notice that whom you do *not* follow on Twitter is at least as important as whom you do follow. Optimize your twitter feed, so that you don't clutter away an excellent opportunity to find out about the most exciting and inspiring new developments in your field.<br></p><h2 id=\"3__Organize_the_papers_that_come_flying_your_way_\">3. Organize the papers that come flying your way.</h2><p>To harness your daily literature upkeep for avoiding future literature reviews, be sure to organize the work you encounter. <a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com/\">Mendeley</a> is a useful, and mostly free, tool for doing this, but there are many of them. (Those of us who are old and remember typing out references letter by letter, will especially appreciate the convenience of a citation manager. It will never be a good use of your time to have to think about what part of a citation should be italicized.) Once the time comes to write your next proposal or paper, you have a treasure trove of results that you've already thought about, readily available at your fingertips.<br></p><h2 id=\"4__Make_it_fun_\">4. Make it fun.</h2><p>This is the most important point. It's much easier to absorb information that you care about. One way that I hacked this in my current literature review is that I reached out to a number of authors that I had encountered in my literature search for an informal chat. This was one of the best experiences of scientific exchange I've ever had! I talked to scientists in Louisiana, Greece, and Australia, all of whom had several years more experience with my topic of interest than I did. Once you've heard a scientist tell you about their own paper - what part of the project was hard, what was interesting, what parts are only there because of reviewer request etc. - the content of their paper pops out at you in a much more colorful and living way. It's no longer such a chore to look at a paper when, instead of some dry black-and-white characters on a page, it's a friend's documentation of their work and thought process. That said, it's definitely a good idea to take a look at a paper *before* you reach out to its author. But having a scheduled call is also a good incentive to engage more deeply with your reading process.<br></p><p>There. I hope that's somewhat helpful. Go forth, and enjoy your reading!</p>",

      "markdown": "This is cross-posted from my [personal blog](https://katarinaslama.github.io/2020/05/17/OpenAI-blog5/), where I share thoughts on my work and learning process in the OpenAI Scholars Program. I thank Ruby Bloom for suggesting that I share the post here as well.\n\n**OpenAI Scholars: Fifth Steps - The Dreaded Literature Review**\n================================================================\n\nThe [OpenAI Scholars](https://openai.com/blog/openai-scholars-spring-2020/) , and I among them, recently completed a project proposal for the second half of our program. Having recently finished a PhD, writing a proposal and doing the requisite literature review, should be second nature. But literature reviews were always my least favorite part of research.  \n\nFortunately, I'm in good company. In a previous life as a young aspiring neuroscientist, I once attended a talk by [David Hubel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1981/hubel/facts/) . When asked for tips about how to \"keep up with the literature\", I recall that Professor Hubel responded: \"You know, at some point in your career, you have to decide if you want to be a consumer - or a producer.\" He elaborated that he would only really look at papers that his [advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kuffler) or his long-term collaborator [Torsten Wiesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsten_Wiesel) pointed him to.\n\n![](https://katarinaslama.github.io/images/hubel.jpg)\n\nThere's good reason to want to avoid literature reviews. To begin with, the problem formulation is intractable: \"Know everything.\" If you've spent any amount of time around academics, it will soon become apparent that this is exactly what they expect from you. \"Oh you have**n't** read that paper?\" The assumption is that you have read every paper there is.  \n\nOf course, this is an impossible task. Last time I visited Google Scholar and searched on a few project-relevant terms, I encountered 105,000 papers. It takes me a full day to read and satisfactorily understand an academic paper. So reading 105 kilo-papers would take me 288 years. And I had hoped to also do some coding work during the Scholars program.  \n\nNow suppose you want to cook a [ghormeh sabzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghormeh_sabzi) . To do so, you buy yourself a can of [ghormeh sabzi mix](https://www.sadaf.com/sadaf-herbs-mix-sabzi-ghormeh-14-1380) , and follow the instructions on the can. There are about five steps. However, as ubiquitous an activity as the literature review is (in academic circles anyway), I am yet to encounter an honest and pragmatic recipe for how they are to be cooked. I really wish there was one.  \n\nI for one am a great fan of [Thich Nhat Hanh's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh) how-to books. Some of my favorite titles among Nhat Hanh's books are: \"How to sit\", \"How to relax\", and - perhaps the best one - \"How to see\".  \n\n![](https://katarinaslama.github.io/images/howtosee.jpg)\n\nI wish there had been a series of books like that available for me as a beginning grad student, covering seemingly trivial but often intractable activities like \"How to read a paper\", \"How to attend a talk\" and, indeed, \"How to do a literature review\".\n\n(**Updated: Apparently there exist plenty of expositions on this topic. See the comment by AllAmericanBreakfast below. I hope that some of the ideas in this post might nonetheless add something to whatever else you might have read.)\n\nSo, this is a first draft toward such a pragmatic guide to literature reviews: How to do them and how to avoid them. Again, this is absolutely in draft form, so please do send your constructive feedback my way.\n\n**How to do a literature review**\n=================================\n\n1\\. Start with your goal.\n-------------------------\n\nDo not start your literature review with the goal of \"doing a literature review\". Notice that such a goal does not have an end point when you can look at your work in satisfaction and notice that you are done. (Unless you have 288 years to spare). Instead, start with identifying your goal: Why are you doing this literature review? In my case, I had completed a spreadsheet with 50 papers, including their main points, type of neural recording, type of network architecture, a usefulness rating etc., by the time I realized that I had not identified my goal. I had to take a deliberate step back to recall that one goal of my literature review was to write a project proposal. Hence, my literature review should be tailored to that goal. Once I realized that, I decided to approach my work from the opposite direction: I drafted a project proposal \"blind\" to the literature. In other words, I wrote out a draft in bullet points with only the information I had in my mind. Once I had done that, it became quite obvious where I had knowledge gaps. Those knowledge gaps created the questions that I needed to search for in my literature review (see point 3 below.)  \n\n2\\. Decide what constitutes success: How will you know that you're done?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is really important, and it's often the hardest part with an infinity-project like a literature review. In my case, the done-point was when I had completed the project proposal. But how do I know that my proposal is good enough? In practice, for me, it was when the deadline hit. If you have come up with better metrics and markers for when to consider a project completed, please do let me know.  \n\n3\\. Define your questions.\n--------------------------\n\nWhen doing a literature review, it's critical to know what information you're searching for. Trying to absorb all the information contained in a dense document is rarely a good plan. In my case, my questions fell out of my first, naive project proposal draft. I also talked my project through with a [friend](https://sites.google.com/site/falklieder/home) , who is a more experienced researcher. He offered the following thought points for guidance to a literature review for a new project:  \n\n1\\. The goal for your literature review should be to identify the problem that your project will solve. Your project might either aim to solve a new problem, or improve on an existing method.  \n2\\. Use the literature revew to identify \\*gaps\\* in the literature: What do we not yet know?  \n3\\. What are the shortcomings of existing methods to solve the problem? Why are current approaches not yet useful in practice? What is the bottleneck?  \n\n4\\. Answer your questions.\n--------------------------\n\nI think this is self-explanatory, but please let me know if not! One thing to keep in mind here is to not get lost in literature-tangents while finding answers to your questions. Provided your goal is to finish, that is. If you have the time to go off on philosophical tangents, feel free and enjoy!  \n\n5\\. Stop.\n---------\n\nJust stop. Seriously. When you're done, you should stop. Go take a walk outside.  \n\n**How to avoid doing literature reviews**\n=========================================\n\nThe first section described the second-best way of doing a literature review. The best way to do a literature review is to not do a literature review. The art of avoiding doing a literature review is very similar to the art of avoiding deep cleaning your house: Keep it tidy on a daily basis. (Just like with deep cleaning your house, you probably still need to do a proper deep dive into the literature from time to time, just not as frequently as you would if you didn't have a routine of daily up-keep). Here are some ideas for \"keeping up with the literature\":  \n\n1\\. Mind whom you follow on Google Scholar.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you've gotten your feet a little bit wet in your field of interest, you will have a clue of who often writes interesting papers. If you follow them on Google Scholar, you will be notified as they publish more interesting stuff.  \n\n2\\. Mind whom you follow on Twitter.\n------------------------------------\n\nThis is especially true of deep learning, but it's becoming increasingly common in every scientific field: Those same people that you follow on Google Scholar - they will also be tweeting when they publish new cool stuff. Also when their friends publish new cool stuff. They might even highlight the most interesting aspect of their work through a figure, or a digestible blog post. Notice that whom you do \\*not\\* follow on Twitter is at least as important as whom you do follow. Optimize your twitter feed, so that you don't clutter away an excellent opportunity to find out about the most exciting and inspiring new developments in your field.  \n\n3\\. Organize the papers that come flying your way.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTo harness your daily literature upkeep for avoiding future literature reviews, be sure to organize the work you encounter. [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) is a useful, and mostly free, tool for doing this, but there are many of them. (Those of us who are old and remember typing out references letter by letter, will especially appreciate the convenience of a citation manager. It will never be a good use of your time to have to think about what part of a citation should be italicized.) Once the time comes to write your next proposal or paper, you have a treasure trove of results that you've already thought about, readily available at your fingertips.  \n\n4\\. Make it fun.\n----------------\n\nThis is the most important point. It's much easier to absorb information that you care about. One way that I hacked this in my current literature review is that I reached out to a number of authors that I had encountered in my literature search for an informal chat. This was one of the best experiences of scientific exchange I've ever had! I talked to scientists in Louisiana, Greece, and Australia, all of whom had several years more experience with my topic of interest than I did. Once you've heard a scientist tell you about their own paper - what part of the project was hard, what was interesting, what parts are only there because of reviewer request etc. - the content of their paper pops out at you in a much more colorful and living way. It's no longer such a chore to look at a paper when, instead of some dry black-and-white characters on a page, it's a friend's documentation of their work and thought process. That said, it's definitely a good idea to take a look at a paper \\*before\\* you reach out to its author. But having a scheduled call is also a good incentive to engage more deeply with your reading process.  \n\nThere. I hope that's somewhat helpful. Go forth, and enjoy your reading!"

      "markdown": "**Reply to:** Benja~2010~'s [Self-modification is the correct justification for updateless decision theory](/lw/22m/selfmodification_is_the_correct_justification_for/); Wei Dai's [Late great filter is not bad news](/lw/214/late_great_filter_is_not_bad_news/)\n\n_\"[P-zombie](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Philosophical_zombie)\" is short for \"**p**hilosophical zombie\", but here I'm going to re-interpret it as standing for \"**p**hysical philosophical zombie\", and contrast it to what I call an \"l-zombie\", for \"**l**ogical philosophical zombie\"._\n\nA p-zombie is an ordinary human body with an ordinary human brain that does all the usual things that human brains do, such as the things that cause us to move our mouths and say \"I think, therefore I am\", but that _isn't conscious_. (The usual consensus on LW is that p-zombies can't exist, but some philosophers disagree.) The notion of p-zombie accepts that human _behavior_ is produced by physical, computable processes, but imagines that these physical processes don't produce _conscious experience_ without some additional epiphenomenal factor.\n\nAn l-zombie is a human being that could have existed, but doesn't: a Turing machine which, if anybody ever ran it, would compute that human's thought processes (and its interactions with a simulated environment); that would, if anybody ever ran it, compute the human saying \"I think, therefore I am\"; _but that never gets run_, and therefore isn't conscious. (If it's conscious anyway, it's not an l-zombie by this definition.) The notion of l-zombie accepts that human behavior is produced by computable processes, but supposes that these computational processes don't produce conscious experience without being physically instantiated.\n\nActually, there probably aren't any l-zombies: [The way the evidence is pointing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Max_Tegmark.27s_four_levels), it seems like we probably live in a spatially infinite universe where every physically possible human brain is instantiated _somewhere_, although some are instantiated less frequently than others; and if that's not true, there are the \"bubble universes\" arising from cosmological inflation, the branches of many-worlds quantum mechanics, and Tegmark's \"level IV\" multiverse of all mathematical structures, all suggesting again that all possible human brains are in fact instantiated. But (a) I don't think that even with all that evidence, we can be _overwhelmingly_ certain that all brains are instantiated; and, more importantly actually, (b) I think that thinking about l-zombies can yield some useful insights into how to think about worlds where all humans exist, but some of them have more measure (\"magical reality fluid\") than others.\n\nSo I ask: Suppose that we do indeed live in a world with l-zombies, where only some of all mathematically possible humans exist physically, and only those that do have conscious experiences. How should someone living in such a world reason about their experiences, and how should they make decisions — keeping in mind that if they were an l-zombie, they would still say \"_I_ have conscious experiences, so clearly _I_ can't be an l-zombie\"?\n\nIf we _can't_ update on our experiences to conclude that someone having these experiences must exist in the physical world, then we must of course conclude that we are almost certainly l-zombies: After all, if the physical universe isn't combinatorially large, the vast majority of mathematically possible conscious human experiences are _not_ instantiated. You might argue that the universe you live in seems to run on relatively simple physical rules, so it should have high prior probability; but we haven't really figured out the exact rules of our universe, and although what we understand seems compatible with the hypothesis that there are simple underlying rules, that's not really proof that there _are_ such underlying rules, if \"the _real_ universe has simple rules, but _we_ are l-zombies living in some random simulation with a hodgepodge of rules (that isn't actually ran)\" has the same prior probability; and worse, if you don't have all we _do_ know about these rules loaded into your brain right now, you can't really verify that they make sense, since there is some mathematically possible simulation whose initial state has you _remember_ seeing evidence that such simple rules exist, even if they don't; and much worse still, even if there _are_ such simple rules, what evidence do you have that if these rules were actually executed, they would produce _you_? Only the fact that you, like, exist, but we're asking what happens if we don't let you update on that.\n\nI find myself quite unwilling to accept this conclusion that I shouldn't update, in the world we're talking about. I mean, I _actually_ have conscious experiences. I, like, feel them and stuff! Yes, true, my slightly altered alter ego would reason the same way, and it would be wrong; but _I'm_ right...\n\n...and _that_ actually seems to offer a way out of the conundrum: Suppose that I decide to update on my experience. Then so will my alter ego, the l-zombie. This leads to a lot of l-zombies concluding \"I think, therefore I am\", and being _wrong_, and a lot of actual people concluding \"I think, therefore I am\", and being _right_. All the thoughts that are actually _consciously experienced_ are, in fact, correct. This doesn't seem like such a terrible outcome. Therefore, I'm willing to provisionally endorse the reasoning \"I think, therefore I am\", and to endorse updating on the fact that I have conscious experiences to draw inferences about physical reality — taking into account the simulation argument, of course, and conditioning on living in a small universe, which is all I'm discussing in this post.\n\n_**NB.**_ There's still something quite uncomfortable about the idea that all of my behavior, including the fact that I say \"I think therefore I am\", is explained by the mathematical process, but actually _being_ conscious requires some extra magical reality fluid. So I still feel confused, and using the word l-zombie in analogy to p-zombie is a way of highlighting that. But this line of reasoning still feels like progress. FWIW.\n\nBut if _that's_ how we justify _believing_ that we physically exist, that has some implications for how we should decide what to _do_. The argument is that nothing very bad happens if the l-zombies wrongly conclude that they actually exist. Mostly, that also seems to be true if they _act_ on that belief: mostly, what l-zombies do doesn't seem to influence what happens in the real world, so if only things that actually happen are morally important, it doesn't seem to matter what the l-zombies decide to do. But there are exceptions.\n\nConsider the [counterfactual mugging](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Counterfactual_mugging): Accurate and trustworthy [Omega](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Omega) appears to you and explains that it just has thrown a very biased coin that had only a 1/1000 chance of landing heads. As it turns out, this coin _has_ in fact landed heads, and now Omega is offering you a choice: It can either (A) create a Friendly AI or (B) destroy humanity. Which would you like? There is a catch, though: Before it threw the coin, Omega made a prediction about what you would do if the coin fell heads (and it was able to make a confident prediction about what you would choose). If the coin had fallen tails, it would have created an FAI if it has predicted that you'd choose (B), and it would have destroyed humanity if it has predicted that you would choose (A). (If it hadn't been able to make a confident prediction about what you would choose, it would just have destroyed humanity outright.)\n\nThere is a clear argument that, if you expect to find yourself in a situation like this in the future, you would want to self-modify into somebody who would choose (B), since this gives humanity a much larger chance of survival. Thus, a decision theory stable under self-modification would answer (B). But if you update on the fact that you consciously experience Omega telling you that the coin landed heads, (A) would seem to be the better choice!\n\nOne way of looking at this is that if the coin falls tails, the l-zombie that is told the coin landed heads still exists mathematically, and this l-zombie now has the power to influence what happens in the real world. If the argument for updating was that nothing bad happens even though the l-zombies get it wrong, well, that argument breaks here. The mathematical process that is your mind doesn't have any evidence about whether the coin landed heads or tails, because as a mathematical object it exists in both possible worlds, and it has to make a decision in both worlds, and that decision affects humanity's future in both worlds.\n\nBack in 2010, I wrote [a post](/lw/22m/selfmodification_is_the_correct_justification_for/) arguing that yes, you would want to self-modify into something that would choose (B), but that that was the _only_ reason why you'd want to choose (B). Here's a variation on the above scenario that illustrates the point I was trying to make back then: Suppose that Omega tells you that it actually threw its coin a million years ago, and if it had fallen tails, it would have turned Alpha Centauri purple. Now throughout your history, the argument goes, you would never have had any motive to self-modify into something that chooses (B) in this particular scenario, because you've always known that Alpha Centauri isn't, in fact, purple.\n\nBut this argument assumes that you know you're not a l-zombie; if the coin had in fact fallen tails, you wouldn't exist as a conscious being, but you'd still exist as a mathematical decision-making process, and that process would be able to influence the real world, so you-the-decision-process can't reason that \"I think, therefore I am, therefore the coin must have fallen heads, therefore I should choose (A).\" Partly because of this, I now accept choosing (B) as the (most likely to be) correct choice even in that case. (The rest of my change in opinion has to do with all ways of making my earlier intuition formal getting into trouble in decision problems where you can influence whether you're brought into existence, but that's a topic for another post.)\n\nHowever, should you _feel cheerful_ while you're announcing your choice of (B), since with high (prior) probability, you've just saved humanity? That would lead to an actual conscious being feeling cheerful if the coin has landed heads and humanity is going to be destroyed, and an l-zombie computing, but _not_ actually experiencing, cheerfulness if the coin has landed heads and humanity is going to be saved. Nothing good comes out of feeling cheerful, not even alignment of a conscious' being's map with the physical territory. So I think the correct thing is to choose (B), and to be deeply sad about it.\n\nYou may be asking why I should care what the right probabilities to assign or the right feelings to have are, since these don't seem to play any role in making decisions; sometimes you make your decisions as if updating on your conscious experience, but sometimes you don't, and you always get the right answer if you _don't_ update in the first place. Indeed, I expect that the \"correct\" design for an AI is to fundamentally use (more precisely: approximate) updateless decision theory (though I also expect that probabilities updated on the AI's sensory input will be useful for many intermediate computations), and \"I compute, therefore I am\"-style reasoning will play no fundamental role in the AI. And I think the same is true for humans' decisions — the correct way to act is given by updateless reasoning. But as a human, I find myself unsatisfied by not being able to have a picture of what the physical world probably looks like. I may not need one to figure out how I should act; I still want one, not for instrumental reasons, but because I want one. In a small universe where most mathematically possible humans are l-zombies, the argument in this post seems to give me a justification to say \"I think, therefore I am, therefore probably I either live in a simulation or what I've learned about the laws of physics describes how the real world works (even though there are many l-zombies who are thinking similar thoughts but are wrong about them).\"\n\nAnd because of this, even though I disagree with my 2010 post, I also still disagree with [Wei Dai's 2010 post arguing that a late Great Filter is good news](/lw/214/late_great_filter_is_not_bad_news/), which my own 2010 post was trying to argue against. Wei argued that if Omega gave you a choice between (A) destroying the world _now_ and (B) having Omega destroy the world a million years ago (so that you are never instantiated as a conscious being, though your choice as an l-zombie still influences the real world), then you would choose (A), to give humanity at least the time it's had so far. Wei concluded that this means that if you learned that the Great Filter is in our future, rather than our past, that must be _good news_, since if you could choose where to place the filter, you should place it in the future. I now agree with Wei that (A) is the right choice, but I don't think that you should be _happy_ about it. And similarly, I don't think you should be happy about news that tells you that the Great Filter is later than you might have expected."

This confused the living daylights out of early quantum experimenters, because it meant that things behaved differently when they tried to \"measure\" them.&nbsp; But it's not only measuring instruments that do the trick - any sensitive physical element will do - and the distinctness of configurations is a physical fact, not a fact about our knowledge.&nbsp; There is no need to suppose that the universe cares what we think.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pg/where_philosophy_meets_science/\">Where Philosophy Meets Science</a>:&nbsp; In retrospect, supposing that quantum physics had anything to do with consciousness was a big mistake.&nbsp; Could philosophers have told the physicists so?&nbsp; But we don't usually see philosophers sponsoring major advances in physics; why not?</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/\">Can You Prove Two Particles Are Identical?</a></strong>:&nbsp; You wouldn't think that it would be possible to do an experiment that told you that two particles are <em>completely</em> identical - not just to the limit of experimental precision, but <em>perfectly.</em>&nbsp; You could even give a precise-sounding philosophical argument for <em>why</em> it was not possible - but the argument would have a deeply buried assumption.&nbsp; Quantum physics violates this deep assumption, making the experiment easy.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/\">Classical Configuration Spaces</a></strong>:&nbsp; How to visualize the state of a system of two 1-dimensional particles, as a single point in 2-dimensional space.&nbsp; A preliminary step before moving into...</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/pj/the_quantum_arena/\">The Quantum Arena</a></strong>:&nbsp; Instead of a system state being associated with a single point in a classical configuration space, the instantaneous real state of a quantum system is a complex amplitude distribution over a quantum configuration space.&nbsp; What creates the illusion of \"individual particles\", like an electron caught in a trap, is a plaid distribution - one that happens to factor into the product of two parts.&nbsp; It is the whole distribution that evolves when a quantum system evolves.&nbsp; Individual configurations don't have physics; amplitude distributions have physics.&nbsp; Quantum entanglement is the general case; quantum <em>independence</em> is the special case.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/pk/feynman_paths/\">Feynman Paths</a></strong>:&nbsp; Instead of thinking that a photon takes a single straight path through space, we can regard it as taking all possible paths through space, and adding the amplitudes for every possible path.&nbsp; Nearly all the paths cancel out - unless we do clever quantum things, so that some paths add instead of canceling out.&nbsp; Then we can make light do funny tricks for us, like reflecting off a mirror in such a way that the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.&nbsp; But ordinarily, nearly all the paths except an extremely narrow band, cancel out - this is one of the keys to recovering the hallucination of classical physics.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/\">No Individual Particles</a></strong>:&nbsp; One of the chief ways to confuse yourself while thinking about quantum mechanics, is to think as if photons were little billiard balls bouncing around.&nbsp; The appearance of little billiard balls is a special case of a deeper level on which there are only multiparticle configurations and amplitude flows.&nbsp; It is easy to set up physical situations in which there exists no fact of the matter as to which electron was originally which.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/\">Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms</a>, <a href=\"/lw/po/three_dialogues_on_identity/\">Three Dialogues on Identity</a>:&nbsp; Given that there's no such thing as \"the same atom\", whether you are \"the same person\" from one time to another can't possibly depend on whether you're made out of the same atoms.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pp/decoherence/\"><strong>Decoherence</strong></a>:&nbsp; A quantum system that factorizes can evolve into a system that doesn't factorize, destroying the illusion of independence.&nbsp; But entangling a quantum system with its environment, can <em>appear</em> to destroy entanglements that are already present.&nbsp; Entanglement with the environment can separate out the pieces of an amplitude distribution, preventing them from interacting with each other.&nbsp; Decoherence is fundamentally symmetric in time, but appears asymmetric because of the second law of thermodynamics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pq/the_socalled_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle/\"><strong>The So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</strong></a>:&nbsp; Unlike classical physics, in quantum physics it is not possible to separate out a particle's \"position\" from its \"momentum\".&nbsp; The evolution of the amplitude distribution over time, involves things like taking the second derivative in space and multiplying by <em>i</em> to get the first derivative in time.&nbsp; The end result of this time evolution rule is that blobs of particle-presence appear to race around in physical space.&nbsp; The notion of \"an exact particular momentum\" or \"an exact particular position\" is not something that can physically happen, it is a tool for analyzing amplitude distributions by taking them apart into a sum of simpler waves.&nbsp; This uses the assumption and fact of linearity: the evolution of the whole wavefunction seems to always be the additive sum of the evolution of its pieces.&nbsp; Using this tool, we can see that if you take apart the same distribution into a sum of positions and a sum of momenta, they cannot both be sharply concentrated at the same time.&nbsp; When you \"observe\" a particle's position, that is, decohere its positional distribution by making it interact with a sensor, you take its wave packet apart into two pieces; then the two pieces evolve differently.&nbsp; The Heisenberg Principle definitely does not say that knowing about the particle, or consciously seeing it, will make the universe behave differently.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pr/which_basis_is_more_fundamental/\">Which Basis Is More Fundamental?</a>:&nbsp; The position basis can be computed locally in the configuration space; the momentum basis is not local.&nbsp; Why care about locality?&nbsp; Because it is a very deep principle; reality itself seems to favor it in some way.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/ps/where_physics_meets_experience/\">Where Physics Meets Experience</a>:&nbsp; Meet the Ebborians, who reproduce by fission.&nbsp; The Ebborian brain is like a thick sheet of paper that splits down its thickness.&nbsp; They frequently experience dividing into two minds, and can talk to their other selves.&nbsp; It seems that their unified theory of physics is almost finished, and can answer every question, when one Ebborian asks:&nbsp; When <em>exactly</em> does one Ebborian become two people?</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pt/where_experience_confuses_physicists/\">Where Experience Confuses Physicists</a>:&nbsp; It then turns out that the entire planet of Ebbore is splitting along a fourth-dimensional thickness, duplicating all the people within it.&nbsp; But why does the apparent chance of \"ending up\" in one of those worlds, equal the square of the fourth-dimensional thickness?&nbsp; Many mysterious answers are proposed to this question, and one non-mysterious one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/\"><strong>On Being Decoherent</strong></a>:&nbsp; When a sensor measures a particle whose amplitude distribution stretches over space - perhaps seeing if the particle is to the left or right of some dividing line - then the standard laws of quantum mechanics call for the sensor+particle system to evolve into a state of (particle left, sensor measures LEFT) + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT).&nbsp; But when we humans look at the sensor, it only seems to say \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\", never a mixture like \"LIGFT\".&nbsp; This, of course, is because we ourselves are made of particles, and subject to the standard quantum laws that imply decoherence.&nbsp; Under standard quantum laws, the final state is (particle left, sensor measures LEFT, human sees \"LEFT\") + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT, human sees \"RIGHT\").</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/\">The Conscious Sorites Paradox</a>:&nbsp; Decoherence is implicit in quantum physics, not an extra law on top of it.&nbsp; Asking exactly when \"one world\" splits into \"two worlds\" may be like asking when, if you keep removing grains of sand from a pile, it stops being a \"heap\".&nbsp; Even if you're inside the world, there may not be a definite answer.&nbsp; This puzzle does not arise only in quantum physics; the Ebborians could face it in a classical universe, or we could build sentient flat computers that split down their thickness.&nbsp; Is this really a physicist's problem?</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/pw/decoherence_is_pointless/\">Decoherece is Pointless</a>:&nbsp; There is no exact point at which decoherence suddenly happens.&nbsp; All of quantum mechanics is continuous and differentiable, and decoherent processes are no exception to this.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/px/decoherent_essences/\">Decoherent Essences</a>:&nbsp; Decoherence is implicit within physics, not an extra law on top of it.&nbsp; You can choose representations that make decoherence harder to see, just like you can choose representations that make apples harder to see, but exactly the same physical process still goes on; the apple doesn't disappear and neither does decoherence.&nbsp; If you could make decoherence magically go away by choosing the right representation, we wouldn't need to shield quantum computers from the environment.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/py/the_born_probabilities/\"><strong>The Born Probabilities</strong></a>:&nbsp; The last <em>serious </em>mysterious question left in quantum physics:&nbsp; When a quantum world splits in two, why do we seem to have a greater probability of ending up in the larger blob, exactly proportional to the integral of the squared modulus?&nbsp; It's an open problem, but non-mysterious answers have been proposed.&nbsp; Try not to go funny in the head about it.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/pz/decoherence_as_projection/\">Decoherence as Projection</a></strong>:&nbsp; Since quantum evolution is linear and unitary, decoherence can be seen as projecting a wavefunction onto orthogonal subspaces.&nbsp; This can be neatly illustrated using polarized photons and the angle of the polarized sheet that will absorb or transmit them.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q0/entangled_photons/\">Entangled Photons</a></strong>:&nbsp; Using our newly acquired understanding of photon polarizations, we see how to construct a quantum state of two photons in which, when you measure one of them, the person in the same world as you, will always find that the opposite photon has opposite quantum state.&nbsp; This is not because any influence is transmitted; it is just decoherence that takes place in a very symmetrical way, as can readily be observed in our calculations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"Many_Worlds_\">Many Worlds:</strong></p>\n<p>(At this point in the sequence, most of the mathematical background has been built up, and we are ready to evaluate interpretations of quantum mechanics.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/q1/bells_theorem_no_epr_reality/\"><strong>Bell's Theorem: No EPR \"Reality\"</strong></a>:&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; This post was designed to be read as a stand-alone, if desired.)&nbsp; Originally, the discoverers of quantum physics thought they had discovered an incomplete description of reality - that there was some deeper physical process they were missing, and this was why they couldn't predict exactly the results of quantum experiments.&nbsp; The math of Bell's Theorem is surprisingly simple, and we walk through it.&nbsp; Bell's Theorem rules out being able to <em>locally</em> predict a <em>single, unique</em> outcome of measurements - ruling out a way that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen once defined \"reality\".&nbsp; This shows how deep implicit philosophical assumptions can go.&nbsp; If worlds can split, so that there is no single unique outcome, then Bell's Theorem is no problem.&nbsp; Bell's Theorem does, however, rule out the idea that quantum physics describes our partial knowledge of a deeper physical state that could locally produce single outcomes - any such description will be inconsistent.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/\"><strong>Spooky Action at a Distance: The No-Communication Theorem</strong></a>:&nbsp; As Einstein argued long ago, the quantum physics of his era - that is, the single-global-world interpretation of quantum physics, in which experiments have single unique random results - violates Special Relativity; it imposes a preferred space of simultaneity and requires a mysterious influence to be transmitted faster than light; which mysterious influence can never be used to transmit any useful information.&nbsp; Getting rid of the single global world dispels this mystery and puts everything back to normal again.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/\">Decoherence is Simple</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"/lw/q4/decoherence_is_falsifiable_and_testable/\">Decoherence is Falsifiable and Testable</a></strong>:&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp; Designed to be standalone readable.)&nbsp; An epistle to the physicists.&nbsp; To probability theorists, words like \"simple\", \"falsifiable\", and \"testable\" have exact mathematical meanings, which are there for very strong reasons.&nbsp; The (minority?) faction of physicists who say that many-worlds is \"not falsifiable\" or that it \"violates Occam's Razor\" or that it is \"untestable\", are committing the same kind of mathematical crime as non-physicists who invent their own theories of gravity that go as inverse-cube.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why I, a non-physicist, dared to talk about physics - because I saw (some!) physicists using probability theory in a way that was simply wrong.&nbsp; Not just criticizable, but outright mathematically wrong:&nbsp; 2 + 2 = 3.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q5/quantum_nonrealism/\">Quantum Non-Realism</a></strong>:&nbsp; \"Shut up and calculate\" is the best approach you can take when none of your theories are very good.&nbsp; But that is not the same as claiming that \"Shut up!\" actually <em>is</em> a theory of physics.&nbsp; Saying \"I don't know what these equations mean, but they seem to work\" is a very different matter from saying:&nbsp; \"These equations definitely don't mean anything, they just work!\"</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q6/collapse_postulates/\">Collapse Postulates</a></strong>:&nbsp; Early physicists simply didn't think of the possibility of more than one world - it just didn't occur to them, even though it's the straightforward result of applying the quantum laws at all levels.&nbsp; So they accidentally invented a completely and strictly unnecessary part of quantum theory to ensure there was only one world - a law of physics that says that parts of the wavefunction mysteriously and spontaneously disappear when decoherence prevents us from seeing them any more.&nbsp; If such a law really existed, it would be the only non-linear, non-unitary, non-differentiable, non-local, non-CPT-symmetric, acausal, faster-than-light phenomenon in all of physics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/q7/if_manyworlds_had_come_first/\">If Many-Worlds Had Come First</a>:&nbsp; If early physicists had never made the mistake, and thought immediately to apply the quantum laws at all levels to produce macroscopic decoherence, then \"collapse postulates\" would today seem like a completely crackpot theory.&nbsp; In addition to their other problems, like FTL, the collapse postulate would be the only physical law that was informally specified - often in dualistic (mentalistic) terms - because it was the only fundamental law adopted without precise evidence to nail it down.&nbsp; Here, we get a glimpse at that alternate Earth.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q8/many_worlds_one_best_guess/\">Many Worlds, One Best Guess</a></strong>:&nbsp; Summarizes the arguments that nail down macroscopic decoherence, aka the \"many-worlds interpretation\".&nbsp; Concludes that many-worlds <em>wins outright</em> given the current state of evidence.&nbsp; The argument should have been over fifty years ago.&nbsp; New physical evidence could reopen it, but we have no particular reason to expect this.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qz/living_in_many_worlds/\">Living in Many Worlds</a>:&nbsp; The many worlds of quantum mechanics are not some strange, alien universe into which you have been thrust.&nbsp; They are where you have always lived.&nbsp; Egan's Law:&nbsp; \"It all adds up to normality.\"&nbsp; Then why care about quantum physics at all?&nbsp; Because there's still the question of <em>what</em> adds up to normality, and the answer to this question turns out to be, \"Quantum physics.\"&nbsp; If you're thinking of building any strange philosophies around many-worlds, you probably shouldn't - that's not what it's for.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"Timeless_Physics_\">Timeless Physics:</strong></p>\n<p>(Now we depart from what is nailed down in standard physics, and enter into more speculative realms - particularly Julian Barbour's Machian timeless physics.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qm/machs_principle_antiepiphenomenal_physics/\">Mach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics</a></strong>:&nbsp; Could you tell if the whole universe were shifted an inch to the left?&nbsp; Could you tell if the whole universe was traveling left at ten miles per hour?&nbsp; Could you tell if the whole universe was <em>accelerating</em> left at ten miles per hour?&nbsp; Could you tell if the whole universe was rotating?</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qo/relative_configuration_space/\">Relative Configuration Space</a>:&nbsp; Maybe the reason why we can't observe absolute speeds, absolute positions, absolute accelerations, or absolute rotations, is that particles don't <em>have</em> absolute positions - only positions relative to each other.&nbsp; That is, maybe quantum physics takes place in a <em>relative</em> configuration space.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qp/timeless_physics/\">Timeless Physics</a></strong>:&nbsp; What time is it?&nbsp; How do you know?&nbsp; The question \"What time is it right now?\" may make around as much sense as asking \"Where is the universe?\"&nbsp; Not only that, our physics equations may not need a <em>t</em> in them!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qq/timeless_beauty/\">Timeless Beauty</a>:&nbsp; To get rid of time you must reduce it to nontime.&nbsp; In timeless physics, everything that exists is perfectly global or perfectly local.&nbsp; The laws of physics are perfectly global; the configuration space is perfectly local.&nbsp; Every fundamentally existent ontological entity has a unique identity and a unique value.&nbsp; This beauty makes ugly theories much more visibly ugly; a collapse postulate becomes a visible scar on the perfection.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qr/timeless_causality/\">Timeless Causality</a></strong>:&nbsp; Using the modern, Bayesian formulation of causality, we can define causality without talking about time - define it purely in terms of relations.&nbsp; The river of time never flows, but it has a direction.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qx/timeless_identity/\">Timeless Identity</a></strong>:&nbsp; How can you be the same person tomorrow as today, in the river that never flows, when not a drop of water is shared between one time and another?&nbsp; Having used physics to completely trash all naive theories of identity, we reassemble a conception of persons and experiences from what is left.&nbsp; With a surprising practical application...</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/r0/thou_art_physics/\">Thou Art Physics</a>:&nbsp; If the laws of physics control everything we do, then how can our choices be meaningful?&nbsp; Because <em>you are</em> physics.&nbsp; You aren't <em>competing</em> with physics for control of the universe, you are <em>within</em> physics.&nbsp; Anything <em>you</em> control is <em>necessarily</em> controlled by physics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/r1/timeless_control/\">Timeless Control</a>:&nbsp; We throw away \"time\" but retain causality, and with it, the concepts \"control\" and \"decide\".&nbsp; To talk of something as having been \"always determined\" is mixing up a timeless and a timeful conclusion, with paradoxical results.&nbsp; When you take a perspective outside time, you have to be careful not to let your old, timeful intuitions run wild in the absence of their subject matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong id=\"Rationality_and_Science_\">Rationality and Science:</strong></p>\n<p>(Okay, so it was many-worlds all along and collapse theories are silly.&nbsp; Did first-half-of-20th-century physicists <em>really</em> screw up <em>that</em> badly?&nbsp; How did they go wrong?&nbsp; Why haven't modern physicists unanimously endorsed many-worlds, if the issue is that clear-cut?&nbsp; What lessons can we learn from this whole debacle?)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/q9/the_failures_of_eld_science/\">The Failures of Eld Science</a></strong>:&nbsp; A short story set in the same world as <a href=\"/lw/p1/initiation_ceremony/\">Initiation Ceremony</a>.&nbsp; Future physics students look back on the cautionary tale of quantum physics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qa/the_dilemma_science_or_bayes/\">The Dilemma: Science or Bayes?</a>:&nbsp; The failure of first-half-of-20th-century-physics was not due to <em>straying</em> from the scientific method.&nbsp; Science and rationality - that is, Science and Bayesianism - aren't the same thing, and sometimes they give different answers.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qb/science_doesnt_trust_your_rationality/\">Science Doesn't Trust Your Rationality</a></strong>:&nbsp; The reason Science doesn't always agree with the exact, Bayesian, rational answer, is that Science doesn't <em>trust</em> you to be rational.&nbsp; It wants you to go out and gather overwhelming experimental evidence.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qc/when_science_cant_help/\">When Science Can't Help</a>:&nbsp; If you have an idea, Science tells you to test it experimentally.&nbsp; If you spend 10 years testing the idea and the result comes out negative, Science slaps you on the back and says, \"Better luck next time.\"&nbsp; If you want to spend 10 years testing a hypothesis that will actually turn out to be <em>right,</em> you'll have to try to do the thing that Science doesn't trust you to do: think rationally, and figure out the answer <em>before</em> you get clubbed over the head with it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qd/science_isnt_strict_enough/\">Science Isn't Strict <em>Enough</em></a>:&nbsp; Science lets you believe any damn stupid idea that hasn't been refuted by experiment.&nbsp; Bayesianism says there is always an exactly rational degree of belief given your current evidence, and this does not shift a nanometer to the left or to the right depending on your whims.&nbsp; Science is a social freedom - we let people test whatever hypotheses they like, because we don't trust the village elders to decide in advance - but you shouldn't confuse that with an individual standard of rationality.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qe/do_scientists_already_know_this_stuff/\">Do Scientists Already Know This Stuff?</a>:&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Maybe someday it will be part of standard scientific training, but for now, it's not, and the absence is visible.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qf/no_safe_defense_not_even_science/\">No Safe Defense, Not Even Science</a></strong>:&nbsp; Why am I trying to break your trust in Science?&nbsp; Because you can't think and trust at the same time.&nbsp; The social rules of Science are verbal rather than quantitative; it is possible to believe you are following them.&nbsp; With Bayesianism, it is never possible to do an exact calculation and get the exact rational answer that you know exists.&nbsp; You are <em>visibly</em> less than perfect, and so you will not be tempted to trust yourself.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qg/changing_the_definition_of_science/\">Changing the Definition of Science</a>:&nbsp; Many of these ideas are surprisingly conventional, and being floated around by other thinkers.&nbsp; I'm a good deal less of a lonely iconoclast than I seem; maybe it's just the way I talk.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qi/faster_than_science/\">Faster Than Science</a>:&nbsp; Is it really possible to arrive at the truth <em>faster</em> than Science does?&nbsp; Not only is it possible, but the social process of science relies on scientists doing so - when they choose which hypotheses to test.&nbsp; In many answer spaces it's not possible to find the true hypothesis by accident.&nbsp; Science leaves it up to experiment to <em>socially</em> declare who was right, but if there weren't <em>some</em> people who could get it right in the absence of overwhelming experimental proof, science would be stuck.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qj/einsteins_speed/\">Einstein's Speed</a></strong>:&nbsp; Albert was unusually good at finding the right theory in the presence of only a small amount of experimental evidence.&nbsp; Even more unusually, he admitted it - he claimed to know the theory was right, even in advance of the public proof.&nbsp; It's possible to arrive at the truth by thinking great high-minded thoughts of the sort that Science does not trust you to think, but it's a <em>lot harder</em> than arriving at the truth in the presence of overwhelming evidence.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qk/that_alien_message/\">That Alien Message</a></strong>:&nbsp; Einstein used evidence more efficiently than other physicists, but he was still extremely inefficient in an <em>absolute</em> sense.&nbsp; If a huge team of cryptographers and physicists were examining a interstellar transmission, going over it bit by bit, we could deduce principles on the order of Galilean gravity just from seeing one or two frames of a picture.&nbsp; As if the very first human to see an apple fall, had, on the instant, realized that its position went as the square of the time and that this implied constant acceleration.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/ql/my_childhood_role_model/\">My Childhood Role Model</a>:&nbsp; I looked up to the ideal of a Bayesian superintelligence, not Einstein.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/\">Einstein's Superpowers</a></strong>:&nbsp; There's an unfortunate tendency to talk as if Einstein had superpowers - as if, even before Einstein was famous, he had an inherent disposition to be Einstein - a potential as rare as his fame and as magical as his deeds.&nbsp; Yet the way you acquire superpowers is not by being born with them, but by seeing, with a sudden shock, that they are perfectly normal.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/lw/qt/class_project/\">Class Project</a>:&nbsp;

Zombies?](/lw/p7/zombies_zombies/) and **[The Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle](/lw/p9/the_generalized_antizombie_principle/)**:  Don't try to put your consciousness or your personal identity outside physics.  Whatever makes you say \"I think therefore I am\", causes your lips to move; it is within the chains of cause and effect that produce our observed universe.\n*   **[Belief in the Implied Invisible](/lw/pb/belief_in_the_implied_invisible/)**:  If a spaceship goes over the cosmological horizon relative to us, so that it can no longer communicate with us, should we believe that the spaceship instantly ceases to exist?\n\n**Basic Quantum Mechanics:**\n\n*   **[Quantum Explanations](/lw/pc/quantum_explanations/)**:  Quantum mechanics doesn't deserve its fearsome reputation.  If you tell people something is supposed to be mysterious, they won't understand it.  It's human intuitions that are \"strange\" or \"weird\"; physics itself is perfectly normal.  Talking about historical erroneous concepts like \"particles\" or \"waves\" is just asking to confuse people; present the real, unified quantum physics straight out.  The series will take a strictly realist perspective - quantum equations describe something that is real and out there.  Warning:  Although a large faction of physicists agrees with this, it is not universally accepted.  Stronger warning:  I am not even going to present non-realist viewpoints until later, because I think this is a major source of confusion.\n*   **[Configurations and Amplitude](/lw/pd/configurations_and_amplitude/)**:  A preliminary glimpse at the stuff reality is made of.  The classic split-photon experiment with half-silvered mirrors.  Alternative pathways the photon can take, can cancel each other out.  The mysterious measuring tool that tells us the relative squared moduli.\n*   **[Joint Configurations](/lw/pe/joint_configurations/)**:  The laws of physics are inherently over mathematical entities, configurations, that involve multiple particles.  A basic, ontologically existent entity, according to our current understanding of quantum mechanics, does not look like a photon - it looks like a configuration of the universe with \"A photon here, a photon there.\"  Amplitude flows between these configurations can cancel or add; this gives us a way to detect which configurations are distinct.  It is an _experimentally testable_ fact that \"Photon 1 here, photon 2 there\" is the _same configuration_ as \"Photon 2 here, photon 1 there\".\n*   **[Distinct Configurations](/lw/pf/distinct_configurations/)**:  Since configurations are over the combined state of all the elements in a system, adding a sensor that detects whether a particle went one way or the other, becomes a new element of the system that can make configurations \"distinct\" instead of \"identical\".  This confused the living daylights out of early quantum experimenters, because it meant that things behaved differently when they tried to \"measure\" them.  But it's not only measuring instruments that do the trick - any sensitive physical element will do - and the distinctness of configurations is a physical fact, not a fact about our knowledge.  There is no need to suppose that the universe cares what we think.\n*   [Where Philosophy Meets Science](/lw/pg/where_philosophy_meets_science/):  In retrospect, supposing that quantum physics had anything to do with consciousness was a big mistake.  Could philosophers have told the physicists so?  But we don't usually see philosophers sponsoring major advances in physics; why not?\n*   **[Can You Prove Two Particles Are Identical?](/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/)**:  You wouldn't think that it would be possible to do an experiment that told you that two particles are _completely_ identical - not just to the limit of experimental precision, but _perfectly._  You could even give a precise-sounding philosophical argument for _why_ it was not possible - but the argument would have a deeply buried assumption.  Quantum physics violates this deep assumption, making the experiment easy.\n*   **[Classical Configuration Spaces](/lw/pi/classical_configuration_spaces/)**:  How to visualize the state of a system of two 1-dimensional particles, as a single point in 2-dimensional space.  A preliminary step before moving into...\n*   **[The Quantum Arena](/lw/pj/the_quantum_arena/)**:  Instead of a system state being associated with a single point in a classical configuration space, the instantaneous real state of a quantum system is a complex amplitude distribution over a quantum configuration space.  What creates the illusion of \"individual particles\", like an electron caught in a trap, is a plaid distribution - one that happens to factor into the product of two parts.  It is the whole distribution that evolves when a quantum system evolves.  Individual configurations don't have physics; amplitude distributions have physics.  Quantum entanglement is the general case; quantum _independence_ is the special case.\n*   **[Feynman Paths](/lw/pk/feynman_paths/)**:  Instead of thinking that a photon takes a single straight path through space, we can regard it as taking all possible paths through space, and adding the amplitudes for every possible path.  Nearly all the paths cancel out - unless we do clever quantum things, so that some paths add instead of canceling out.  Then we can make light do funny tricks for us, like reflecting off a mirror in such a way that the angle of incidence doesn't equal the angle of reflection.  But ordinarily, nearly all the paths except an extremely narrow band, cancel out - this is one of the keys to recovering the hallucination of classical physics.\n*   **[No Individual Particles](/lw/pl/no_individual_particles/)**:  One of the chief ways to confuse yourself while thinking about quantum mechanics, is to think as if photons were little billiard balls bouncing around.  The appearance of little billiard balls is a special case of a deeper level on which there are only multiparticle configurations and amplitude flows.  It is easy to set up physical situations in which there exists no fact of the matter as to which electron was originally which.\n*   [Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms](/lw/pm/identity_isnt_in_specific_atoms/), [Three Dialogues on Identity](/lw/po/three_dialogues_on_identity/):  Given that there's no such thing as \"the same atom\", whether you are \"the same person\" from one time to another can't possibly depend on whether you're made out of the same atoms.\n*   [**Decoherence**](/lw/pp/decoherence/):  A quantum system that factorizes can evolve into a system that doesn't factorize, destroying the illusion of independence.  But entangling a quantum system with its environment, can _appear_ to destroy entanglements that are already present.  Entanglement with the environment can separate out the pieces of an amplitude distribution, preventing them from interacting with each other.  Decoherence is fundamentally symmetric in time, but appears asymmetric because of the second law of thermodynamics.\n*   [**The So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**](/lw/pq/the_socalled_heisenberg_uncertainty_principle/):  Unlike classical physics, in quantum physics it is not possible to separate out a particle's \"position\" from its \"momentum\".  The evolution of the amplitude distribution over time, involves things like taking the second derivative in space and multiplying by _i_ to get the first derivative in time.  The end result of this time evolution rule is that blobs of particle-presence appear to race around in physical space.  The notion of \"an exact particular momentum\" or \"an exact particular position\" is not something that can physically happen, it is a tool for analyzing amplitude distributions by taking them apart into a sum of simpler waves.  This uses the assumption and fact of linearity: the evolution of the whole wavefunction seems to always be the additive sum of the evolution of its pieces.  Using this tool, we can see that if you take apart the same distribution into a sum of positions and a sum of momenta, they cannot both be sharply concentrated at the same time.  When you \"observe\" a particle's position, that is, decohere its positional distribution by making it interact with a sensor, you take its wave packet apart into two pieces; then the two pieces evolve differently.  The Heisenberg Principle definitely does not say that knowing about the particle, or consciously seeing it, will make the universe behave differently.\n*   [Which Basis Is More Fundamental?](/lw/pr/which_basis_is_more_fundamental/):  The position basis can be computed locally in the configuration space; the momentum basis is not local.  Why care about locality?  Because it is a very deep principle; reality itself seems to favor it in some way.\n*   [Where Physics Meets Experience](/lw/ps/where_physics_meets_experience/):  Meet the Ebborians, who reproduce by fission.  The Ebborian brain is like a thick sheet of paper that splits down its thickness.  They frequently experience dividing into two minds, and can talk to their other selves.  It seems that their unified theory of physics is almost finished, and can answer every question, when one Ebborian asks:  When _exactly_ does one Ebborian become two people?\n*   [Where Experience Confuses Physicists](/lw/pt/where_experience_confuses_physicists/):  It then turns out that the entire planet of Ebbore is splitting along a fourth-dimensional thickness, duplicating all the people within it.  But why does the apparent chance of \"ending up\" in one of those worlds, equal the square of the fourth-dimensional thickness?  Many mysterious answers are proposed to this question, and one non-mysterious one.\n*   [**On Being Decoherent**](/lw/pu/on_being_decoherent/):  When a sensor measures a particle whose amplitude distribution stretches over space - perhaps seeing if the particle is to the left or right of some dividing line - then the standard laws of quantum mechanics call for the sensor+particle system to evolve into a state of (particle left, sensor measures LEFT) + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT).  But when we humans look at the sensor, it only seems to say \"LEFT\" or \"RIGHT\", never a mixture like \"LIGFT\".  This, of course, is because we ourselves are made of particles, and subject to the standard quantum laws that imply decoherence.  Under standard quantum laws, the final state is (particle left, sensor measures LEFT, human sees \"LEFT\") + (particle right, sensor measures RIGHT, human sees \"RIGHT\").\n*   [The Conscious Sorites Paradox](/lw/pv/the_conscious_sorites_paradox/):  Decoherence is implicit in quantum physics, not an extra law on top of it.  Asking exactly when \"one world\" splits into \"two worlds\" may be like asking when, if you keep removing grains of sand from a pile, it stops being a \"heap\".  Even if you're inside the world, there may not be a definite answer.  This puzzle does not arise only in quantum physics; the Ebborians could face it in a classical universe, or we could build sentient flat computers that split down their thickness.  Is this really a physicist's problem?\n*   [Decoherece is Pointless](/lw/pw/decoherence_is_pointless/):  There is no exact point at which decoherence suddenly happens.  All of quantum mechanics is continuous and differentiable, and decoherent processes are no exception to this.\n*   [Decoherent Essences](/lw/px/decoherent_essences/):  Decoherence is implicit within physics, not an extra law on top of it.  You can choose representations that make decoherence harder to see, just like you can choose representations that make apples harder to see, but exactly the same physical process still goes on; the apple doesn't disappear and neither does decoherence.  If you could make decoherence magically go away by choosing the right representation, we wouldn't need to shield quantum computers from the environment.\n*   [**The Born Probabilities**](/lw/py/the_born_probabilities/):  The last _serious_ mysterious question left in quantum physics:  When a quantum world splits in two, why do we seem to have a greater probability of ending up in the larger blob, exactly proportional to the integral of the squared modulus?  It's an open problem, but non-mysterious answers have been proposed.  Try not to go funny in the head about it.\n*   **[Decoherence as Projection](/lw/pz/decoherence_as_projection/)**:  Since quantum evolution is linear and unitary, decoherence can be seen as projecting a wavefunction onto orthogonal subspaces.  This can be neatly illustrated using polarized photons and the angle of the polarized sheet that will absorb or transmit them.\n*   **[Entangled Photons](/lw/q0/entangled_photons/)**:  Using our newly acquired understanding of photon polarizations, we see how to construct a quantum state of two photons in which, when you measure one of them, the person in the same world as you, will always find that the opposite photon has opposite quantum state.  This is not because any influence is transmitted; it is just decoherence that takes place in a very symmetrical way, as can readily be observed in our calculations.\n\n**Many Worlds:**\n\n(At this point in the sequence, most of the mathematical background has been built up, and we are ready to evaluate interpretations of quantum mechanics.)\n\n*   [**Bell's Theorem: No EPR \"Reality\"**](/lw/q1/bells_theorem_no_epr_reality/):  (Note:  This post was designed to be read as a stand-alone, if desired.)  Originally, the discoverers of quantum physics thought they had discovered an incomplete description of reality - that there was some deeper physical process they were missing, and this was why they couldn't predict exactly the results of quantum experiments.  The math of Bell's Theorem is surprisingly simple, and we walk through it.  Bell's Theorem rules out being able to _locally_ predict a _single, unique_ outcome of measurements - ruling out a way that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen once defined \"reality\".  This shows how deep implicit philosophical assumptions can go.  If worlds can split, so that there is no single unique outcome, then Bell's Theorem is no problem.  Bell's Theorem does, however, rule out the idea that quantum physics describes our partial knowledge of a deeper physical state that could locally produce single outcomes - any such description will be inconsistent.\n*   [**Spooky Action at a Distance: The No-Communication Theorem**](/lw/q2/spooky_action_at_a_distance_the_nocommunication/):  As Einstein argued long ago, the quantum physics of his era - that is, the single-global-world interpretation of quantum physics, in which experiments have single unique random results - violates Special Relativity; it imposes a preferred space of simultaneity and requires a mysterious influence to be transmitted faster than light; which mysterious influence can never be used to transmit any useful information.  Getting rid of the single global world dispels this mystery and puts everything back to normal again.\n*   **[Decoherence is Simple](/lw/q3/decoherence_is_simple/)**, **[Decoherence is Falsifiable and Testable](/lw/q4/decoherence_is_falsifiable_and_testable/)**:  (Note:  Designed to be standalone readable.)  An epistle to the physicists.  To probability theorists, words like \"simple\", \"falsifiable\", and \"testable\" have exact mathematical meanings, which are there for very strong reasons.  The (minority?) faction of physicists who say that many-worlds is \"not falsifiable\" or that it \"violates Occam's Razor\" or that it is \"untestable\", are committing the same kind of mathematical crime as non-physicists who invent their own theories of gravity that go as inverse-cube.  This is one of the reasons why I, a non-physicist, dared to talk about physics - because I saw (some!) physicists using probability theory in a way that was simply wrong.  Not just criticizable, but outright mathematically wrong:  2 + 2 = 3.\n*   **[Quantum Non-Realism](/lw/q5/quantum_nonrealism/)**:  \"Shut up and calculate\" is the best approach you can take when none of your theories are very good.  But that is not the same as claiming that \"Shut up!\" actually _is_ a theory of physics.  Saying \"I don't know what these equations mean, but they seem to work\" is a very different matter from saying:  \"These equations definitely don't mean anything, they just work!\"\n*   **[Collapse Postulates](/lw/q6/collapse_postulates/)**:  Early physicists simply didn't think of the possibility of more than one world - it just didn't occur to them, even though it's the straightforward result of applying the quantum laws at all levels.  So they accidentally invented a completely and strictly unnecessary part of quantum theory to ensure there was only one world - a law of physics that says that parts of the wavefunction mysteriously and spontaneously disappear when decoherence prevents us from seeing them any more.  If such a law really existed, it would be the only non-linear, non-unitary, non-differentiable, non-local, non-CPT-symmetric, acausal, faster-than-light phenomenon in all of physics.\n*   [If Many-Worlds Had Come First](/lw/q7/if_manyworlds_had_come_first/):  If early physicists had never made the mistake, and thought immediately to apply the quantum laws at all levels to produce macroscopic decoherence, then \"collapse postulates\" would today seem like a completely crackpot theory.  In addition to their other problems, like FTL, the collapse postulate would be the only physical law that was informally specified - often in dualistic (mentalistic) terms - because it was the only fundamental law adopted without precise evidence to nail it down.  Here, we get a glimpse at that alternate Earth.\n*   **[Many Worlds, One Best Guess](/lw/q8/many_worlds_one_best_guess/)**:  Summarizes the arguments that nail down macroscopic decoherence, aka the \"many-worlds interpretation\".  Concludes that many-worlds _wins outright_ given the current state of evidence.  The argument should have been over fifty years ago.  New physical evidence could reopen it, but we have no particular reason to expect this.\n*   [Living in Many Worlds](/lw/qz/living_in_many_worlds/):  The many worlds of quantum mechanics are not some strange, alien universe into which you have been thrust.  They are where you have always lived.  Egan's Law:  \"It all adds up to normality.\"  Then why care about quantum physics at all?  Because there's still the question of _what_ adds up to normality, and the answer to this question turns out to be, \"Quantum physics.\"  If you're thinking of building any strange philosophies around many-worlds, you probably shouldn't - that's not what it's for.\n\n**Timeless Physics:**\n\n(Now we depart from what is nailed down in standard physics, and enter into more speculative realms - particularly Julian Barbour's Machian timeless physics.)\n\n*   **[Mach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics](/lw/qm/machs_principle_antiepiphenomenal_physics/)**:  Could you tell if the whole universe were shifted an inch to the left?  Could you tell if the whole universe was traveling left at ten miles per hour?  Could you tell if the whole universe was _accelerating_ left at ten miles per hour?  Could you tell if the whole universe was rotating?\n*   [Relative Configuration Space](/lw/qo/relative_configuration_space/):  Maybe the reason why we can't observe absolute speeds, absolute positions, absolute accelerations, or absolute rotations, is that particles don't _have_ absolute positions - only positions relative to each other.  That is, maybe quantum physics takes place in a _relative_ configuration space.\n*   **[Timeless Physics](/lw/qp/timeless_physics/)**:  What time is it?  How do you know?  The question \"What time is it right now?\" may make around as much sense as asking \"Where is the universe?\"  Not only that, our physics equations may not need a _t_ in them!\n*   [Timeless Beauty](/lw/qq/timeless_beauty/):  To get rid of time you must reduce it to nontime.  In timeless physics, everything that exists is perfectly global or perfectly local.  The laws of physics are perfectly global; the configuration space is perfectly local.  Every fundamentally existent ontological entity has a unique identity and a unique value.  This beauty makes ugly theories much more visibly ugly; a collapse postulate becomes a visible scar on the perfection.\n*   **[Timeless Causality](/lw/qr/timeless_causality/)**:  Using the modern, Bayesian formulation of causality, we can define causality without talking about time - define it purely in terms of relations.  The river of time never flows, but it has a direction.\n*   **[Timeless Identity](/lw/qx/timeless_identity/)**:  How can you be the same person tomorrow as today, in the river that never flows, when not a drop of water is shared between one time and another?  Having used physics to completely trash all naive theories of identity, we reassemble a conception of persons and experiences from what is left.  With a surprising practical application...\n*   [Thou Art Physics](/lw/r0/thou_art_physics/):  If the laws of physics control everything we do, then how can our choices be meaningful?  Because _you are_ physics.  You aren't _competing_ with physics for control of the universe, you are _within_ physics.  Anything _you_ control is _necessarily_ controlled by physics.\n*   [Timeless Control](/lw/r1/timeless_control/):  We throw away \"time\" but retain causality, and with it, the concepts \"control\" and \"decide\".  To talk of something as having been \"always determined\" is mixing up a timeless and a timeful conclusion, with paradoxical results.  When you take a perspective outside time, you have to be careful not to let your old, timeful intuitions run wild in the absence of their subject matter.\n\n**Rationality and Science:**\n\n(Okay, so it was many-worlds all along and collapse theories are silly.  Did first-half-of-20th-century physicists _really_ screw up _that_ badly?  How did they go wrong?  Why haven't modern physicists unanimously endorsed many-worlds, if the issue is that clear-cut?  What lessons can we learn from this whole debacle?)\n\n*   **[The Failures of Eld Science](/lw/q9/the_failures_of_eld_science/)**:  A short story set in the same world as [Initiation Ceremony](/lw/p1/initiation_ceremony/).  Future physics students look back on the cautionary tale of quantum physics.\n*   [The Dilemma: Science or Bayes?](/lw/qa/the_dilemma_science_or_bayes/):  The failure of first-half-of-20th-century-physics was not due to _straying_ from the scientific method.  Science and rationality - that is, Science and Bayesianism - aren't the same thing, and sometimes they give different answers.\n*   **[Science Doesn't Trust Your Rationality](/lw/qb/science_doesnt_trust_your_rationality/)**:  The reason Science doesn't always agree with the exact, Bayesian, rational answer, is that Science doesn't _trust_ you to be rational.  It wants you to go out and gather overwhelming experimental evidence.\n*   [When Science Can't Help](/lw/qc/when_science_cant_help/):  If you have an idea, Science tells you to test it experimentally.  If you spend 10 years testing the idea and the result comes out negative, Science slaps you on the back and says, \"Better luck next time.\"  If you want to spend 10 years testing a hypothesis that will actually turn out to be _right,_ you'll have to try to do the thing that Science doesn't trust you to do: think rationally, and figure out the answer _before_ you get clubbed over the head with it.\n*   [Science Isn't Strict _Enough_](/lw/qd/science_isnt_strict_enough/):  Science lets you believe any damn stupid idea that hasn't been refuted by experiment.  Bayesianism says there is always an exactly rational degree of belief given your current evidence, and this does not shift a nanometer to the left or to the right depending on your whims.  Science is a social freedom - we let people test whatever hypotheses they like, because we don't trust the village elders to decide in advance - but you shouldn't confuse that with an individual standard of rationality.\n*   [Do Scientists Already Know This Stuff?](/lw/qe/do_scientists_already_know_this_stuff/):  No.  Maybe someday it will be part of standard scientific training, but for now, it's not, and the absence is visible.\n*   **[No Safe Defense, Not Even Science](/lw/qf/no_safe_defense_not_even_science/)**:  Why am I trying to break your trust in Science?  Because you can't think and trust at the same time.  The social rules of Science are verbal rather than quantitative; it is possible to believe you are following them.  With Bayesianism, it is never possible to do an exact calculation and get the exact rational answer that you know exists.  You are _visibly_ less than perfect, and so you will not be tempted to trust yourself.\n*   [Changing the Definition of Science](/lw/qg/changing_the_definition_of_science/):  Many of these ideas are surprisingly conventional, and being floated around by other thinkers.  I'm a good deal less of a lonely iconoclast than I seem; maybe it's just the way I talk.\n*   [Faster Than Science](/lw/qi/faster_than_science/):  Is it really possible to arrive at the truth _faster_ than Science does?  Not only is it possible, but the social process of science relies on scientists doing so - when they choose which hypotheses to test.  In many answer spaces it's not possible to find the true hypothesis by accident.  Science leaves it up to experiment to _socially_ declare who was right, but if there weren't _some_ people who could get it right in the absence of overwhelming experimental proof, science would be stuck.\n*   **[Einstein's Speed](/lw/qj/einsteins_speed/)**:  Albert was unusually good at finding the right theory in the presence of only a small amount of experimental evidence.  Even more unusually, he admitted it - he claimed to know the theory was right, even in advance of the public proof.  It's possible to arrive at the truth by thinking great high-minded thoughts of the sort that Science does not trust you to think, but it's a _lot harder_ than arriving at the truth in the presence of overwhelming evidence.\n*   **[That Alien Message](/lw/qk/that_alien_message/)**:  Einstein used evidence more efficiently than other physicists, but he was still extremely inefficient in an _absolute_ sense.  If a huge team of cryptographers and physicists were examining a interstellar transmission, going over it bit by bit, we could deduce principles on the order of Galilean gravity just from seeing one or two frames of a picture.  As if the very first human to see an apple fall, had, on the instant, realized that its position went as the square of the time and that this implied constant acceleration.\n*   [My Childhood Role Model](/lw/ql/my_childhood_role_model/):  I looked up to the ideal of a Bayesian superintelligence, not Einstein.\n*   **[Einstein's Superpowers](/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/)**:  There's an unfortunate tendency to talk as if Einstein had superpowers - as if, even before Einstein was famous, he had an inherent disposition to be Einstein - a potential as rare as his fame and as magical as his deeds.  Yet the way you acquire superpowers is not by being born with them, but by seeing, with a sudden shock, that they are perfectly normal.\n*   [Class Project](/lw/qt/class_project/):  From the world of _Initiation Ceremony._  Brennan and the others are faced with their midterm exams.\n*   [Why Quantum?](/lw/qy/why_quantum/):  Why do a series on quantum mechanics?  Some of the many morals that are best illustrated by the tale of quantum mechanics and its misinterpretation."

      "markdown": "In [Keep Your Identity Small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html), Paul Graham argues against associating yourself with labels (i.e. “libertarian,” “feminist,” “gamer,” “American”) because labels constrain what you’ll let yourself believe. It’s a wonderful essay that’s led me to make concrete changes in my life. That said, it’s only about 90% correct. I have two issues with Graham’s argument; one is a semantic quibble, but it leads into the bigger issue, which is a tactic I’ve used to become a better person.\n\nGraham talks about the importance of identity in determining beliefs. This isn’t quite the right framework. I’m a fanatical consequentialist, so I care what actions people take. Beliefs can constrain actions, but identity can also constrain actions directly.\n\nTo give a trivial example from the past week in which beliefs didn’t matter: I had a self-image as someone who didn’t wear jeans or t-shirts. As it happens, there are times when wearing jeans is completely fine, and when other people wore jeans in casual settings, I knew it was appropriate. Nevertheless, I wasn’t able to act on this belief because of my identity. (I finally realized this was silly, consciously discarded that useless bit of identity, and made a point of wearing jeans to a social event.)\n\nWhy is this distinction important? If we’re looking at identify from an action-centered framework, this recommends a different approach from Graham’s.\n\nDo you want to constrain your beliefs? No; you want to go wherever the evidence pushes you. “If X is true, I desire to believe that X is true. If X is not true, I desire to believe that X is not true.” Identity will only get in the way.\n\nDo you want to constrain your actions? Yes! Ten thousand times yes! [Akrasia](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Akrasia) exists. [Commitment devices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_device) are useful. [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) is successful. Identity is one of the most effective tools for the job, if you wield it deliberately.\n\nI’ve cultivated an identity as a person who makes events happen. It took months to instill, but now, when I think “I wish people were doing X,” I instinctively start putting together a group to do X. This manifests in minor ways, like the tree-climbing expedition I put together at the Effective Altruism Summit, and in big ways, like the megameetup we held in Boston. If I hadn’t used my identity to motivate myself, neither of those things would’ve happened, and my life would be poorer.\n\nIdentity is powerful. Powerful things are dangerous, like backhoes and bandsaws. People use them anyway, because sometimes they’re the best tools for the job, and because safety precautions can minimize the danger.\n\nIdentity is hard to change. Identity can be difficult to notice. Identity has unintended consequences. Use this tool only after careful deliberation. What would this identity do to your actions? What would it do to your beliefs? What social consequences would it have? Can you do the same thing with a less dangerous tool? Think twice, and then think again, before you add to your identity. Most identities are a hindrance.\n\nBut please, don’t discard this tool just because some things might go wrong. If you are willful, and careful, and wise, then you can cultivate the identity of the person you always wanted to be."

It's short so it's worth it to read the whole thing right now if you've never seen it.

Cool, now I'll never identify as anything.\" I still think that Paul Graham is pointing out a real cluster of Things That Happen With People, but over time the concept of <em>identity</em>, and <em>identifying as BLANK</em> have started to feel less clear. It feels right to say \"People get dumb when their identity is challenged\" and it even feels sorta axiomatic. Isn't that what it means for something to be part of your identity? Thinking about it more I came up with a bunch of different ways of thinking of myself that all felt like <em>identifying as BLANK</em>, but it felt like unnecessary dropping of nuance to smoosh them all into the single concept of <em>identity</em>.</p><h1 id=\"Identity_Menagerie\">Identity Menagerie</h1><p>Lets look at some examples of what identifying as a BLANK can look like:</p><ul><li>Blake: \"I do Cross Fit. \" </li><li>Jane: \"I'm smart.

When Jane thinks of herself and how she can act on the world, \"being smart\" is a chunk of self-concept that summarizes a lot of her experiences and that she uses to guide decisions she makes. </p><p>Kaj Sotala has a good <a href=\"https://kajsotala.fi/2017/07/how-i-found-fixed-the-root-problem-behind-my-depression-and-anxiety-after-20-years/\">post</a> about how tweaking and modifying his self-concept helped fix parts of his depression and anxiety.</p><h2 id=\"Group_Identity\">Group Identity</h2><p>This is the obvious one that we're all used to. Blake does Cross Fit, hangs out with cross fit people all the time, and loves telling people about all this. All of his Cross Fit buddies support each other and give each other praise for being part of such an awesome group. Someone calling Cross Fit stupid would feel like someone calling him and all of his friends stupid. It would be big and difficult change for Blake to get out of Cross Fit, given that's where most of his social circle is, and where all his free time goes. </p><h2 id=\"Intelligent_Social_Web\">Intelligent Social Web</h2><p>Here's Val describing what he calls the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AqbWna2S85pFTsHH4/the-intelligent-social-web\">Intelligent Social Web</a>:</p><blockquote>I suspect that improv works because we’re doing something a lot like it pretty much all the time.

A lot of (but not all) people get a strong hit of this when they go back to visit their family. If you move away and then make new friends and sort of become a new person (!), you might at first think this is just who you are now.

      "markdown": "_h/t [alyssavance](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alyssavance)_\n\n![](https://rootsofprogress.org/img/the-american-velocipede.jpg)\n\n> The bicycle, as we know it today, was not invented until the late 1800s. Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.\n\n> Why, then, wasn’t it invented much earlier?\n\n> I asked this question [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1143622870477791233), and read some discussion [on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing). People proposed many hypotheses, including:\n\n> **\\+ Technology factors.** Metalworking improved a lot in the 1800s: we got improved iron refining and eventually cheap steel, better processes for shaping metal, and ability to make parts like hollow tubes. Wheel technology improved: [wire-spoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wheel) (aka tension-spoked) wheels replaced heavier designs; vulcanized rubber (1839) was needed for tires; inflatable tires weren’t invented until 1887. Chains, gears, and ball bearings are all crucial parts that require advanced manufacturing techniques for precision and cost.\n\n> **\\+ Design iteration.** Early bicycles were inconvenient and dangerous. The first version didn’t even have pedals. Some versions didn’t have steering, and could only be turned by leaning. (!) The famous “penny-farthing” design, with its huge front wheel, made it impossible to balance with your feet, was prone to tipping forward on a hard stop, and generally left the rider high in the air, all of which increased risk of injury. It took decades of iteration to get to a successful bicycle model.\n\n> **\\+ Quality of roads.** Roads in the 1800s and earlier were terrible by modern standards. Roads were often dirt, rutted from the passage of many carts, turning muddy in the rain. [Macadam paving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam), which gave smooth surfaces to roads, wasn’t invented until about 1820. City roads at the time were paved with cobblestones, which were good for horses but too bumpy for bicycles. (The unevenness was apparently a feature, assisting in the runoff of sewage—leading [one Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing/answer/Chris-Crawford-6) to claim that the construction of city sewers was what opened the door to bicycles.)\n\n> **\\+ Competition from horses.** Horses were a common and accepted mode of transportation at the time. They could deal with all kinds of roads. They could carry heavy loads. Who then needs a bicycle? In this connection, it has been claimed that the bicycle was invented in response to food shortages due to the “[Year without a Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer)”, an 1816 weather event caused by the volcanic explosion of Mt. Tambora the year earlier, which darkened skies and lowered temperatures in many parts of the world. The agricultural crisis caused horses as well as people to starve, which led to some horses being slaughtered for food, and made the remaining ones more expensive to feed. This could have motivated the search for alternatives.\n\n> **\\+ General economic growth.** Multiple commenters pointed out the need for a middle class to provide demand for such an invention. If all you have are a lot of poor peasants and a few aristocrats (who, by the way, have horses, carriages, and drivers), there isn’t much of a market for bicycles. This is more plausible when you realize that bicycles were more of a hobby for entertainment before they became a practical means of transportation.\n\n> **\\+ Cultural factors.** Maybe there was just a general lack of interest in useful mechanical inventions until a certain point in history? But when did this change, and why?\n\n> These are all good hypotheses. But some of them start to buckle under pressure:\n\n> The quality of roads is relevant, but not really the answer. Bicycles can be ridden on dirt roads or sidewalks (although the latter led to run-ins with pedestrians and made bicycles unpopular among the public at first). And historically, roads didn’t improve until _after_bicycles became common—indeed it seems that it was in part the cyclists who called for the improvement of roads.\n\n> I don’t think horses explain it either. A bicycle, from what I’ve read, was cheaper to buy than a horse, and it was certainly cheaper to maintain (if nothing else, you don’t have to feed a bicycle). And it turns out that inventors were interested in the problem of human-powered vehicles, dispensing with the need for horses, for a long time before the modern bicycle. Even Karl von Drais, who invented the first two-wheeled human-powered vehicle after the Year without a Summer, had been working on the problem for years before that.\n\n> Technology factors are more convincing to me. They may have been necessary for bicycles to become practical and cheap enough to take off. But they weren’t needed for early experimentation. Frames can be built of wood. Wheels can be rimmed with metal. Gears can be omitted. Chains can be replaced with belts; some early designs even used treadles instead of pedals, and at least one design drove the wheels with levers, as on a steam locomotive.\n\n> So what’s the real explanation?\n\n([Continue reading](https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle). 2,184 words and lots of great bicycle pictures.)\n\nThis post is a single piece from Jason Crawford's project, [The Roots of Progress](https://rootsofprogress.org/about)_,_ aptly named, to understand the nature and causes of human progress. I haven't thought deeply enough to check his research, but it's a fascinating project. This essay examines a specific piece of technology, but the case study is used to develop and support models of what it takes for progress to occur."
