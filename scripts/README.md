# Rationalia Scripts

This directory contains scripts used to autogenerate this vault from the LessWrong & EA graphql endpoints.

## Timeline

Now that a skeleton has been autogenerated, I'm likely going to throw out all of the code and replace it with scripts that let you synchronize individual files.

There's still a lot of manual fixing todo of links & aliases, missing tags, disambiguation ("Map and Territory" as sequence vs. as concept), etc.
