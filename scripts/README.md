# Rationalia Scripts

Scripts used to autogenerate this vault from the LessWrong & EA graphql endpoints.

As much as possible is autogenerated so that it's easy to automatically update the vault whenever the corresponding wiki pages update. There are a few exceptions:

## Manually generated pages
All of the reading order pages are manually generated, and the posts listed within these were manually converted into lists.
That's because, no surprise, everyone decides to format these suggestions in their own peculiar way. Also, some exist on the old wiki, etc. etc.
