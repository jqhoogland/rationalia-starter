title: Emergent Abililties of Large Language Models
---


> Emergence is when quantitative changes in a system result in qualitative changes in behavior.

> An ability is emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models.


**Task**: 
- Few-shot prompting (take several input-output examples, and ask the model to continue)
- Chain-of-thought prompting

Out-of-domain generalization
- 9-digit addition


# Why?
> For instance, using exact string match as the evaluation metric for long-sequence targets may disguise compounding incremental improvements as emergence.... However, this analysis does not explain why downstream metrics are emergent or enable us to predict the scale at which emergence occurs.

Ex. Measuring cross-entropy loss instead of downstream metrics shows a more gradual shift (in some cases). 

%% Plotting on a log plot may make this more predictable %%
