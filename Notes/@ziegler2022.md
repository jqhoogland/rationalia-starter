> With our chosen thresholds, filtering with our baseline classifier decreases the rate of unsafe completions from about 2.4% to 0.003% on in-distribution data, which is near the limit of our ability to measure. We found that adversarial training significantly increased robustness to the adversarial attacks that we trained on, without affecting in-distribution performance

**Goal**: **high-stakes reliability** (minimax catastrophic outcomes).
**Approach**: [[Adversarial Training]] on toy task of "no injuries in story completion."
