AI provides a new comparison class for understanding what is (currently) unique about human intelligence. 

Griffiths identifies three main constraints: 
- Time 
- Computation
- Communication

These constraints imply other properties of human intelligence: e.g., rapid learning, problem decomposition, cumulative cultural evolution.

These constraints are unlikely to be present with AI.

# Time
- Survival requires learning quickly
- Exploration/exploitation tradeoffs make switching from exploration to exploitation with age natural.
- Natural lifetime sets hard cap on how much we can learn.

# Computation
- Subgoals are necessary if you can't plan all the way to the end.

# Communication
- Language
- Specialization
