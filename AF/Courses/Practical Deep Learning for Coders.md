# Introduction

1943: Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts develop the first model of an artificial neuron
Frank Rosenblatt  developed the Perceptron with a learning ability
Marvin Minsky showed with Rosenblatt how to implement XOR. They anticipated the value of multiple layers but this was largely missed by the community.

1980's: started introducing more layers

David Perkens' advice on teaching: *teach the whole game*
