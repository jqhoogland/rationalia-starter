# Corrigibility

A **corrigible** agent is one that doesn't interfere with what we would intuitively see as attempts to 'correct' the agent, or 'correct' our mistakes in building it; and permits these 'corrections' despite the apparent instrumentally convergent reasoning saying otherwise.

Christiano [suggests](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/EmDuGeRw749sD3GKd/p/fkLYhTQteAu5SinAc) that:
> 1.  A [benign](https://ai-alignment.com/benign-ai-e4eb6ec6d68e) [act-based](https://ai-alignment.com/act-based-agents-8ec926c79e9c) agent will be robustly corrigible if we want it to be.
> 2.  A sufficiently corrigible agent will tend to become more corrigible and benign over time. Corrigibility marks out a broad basin of attraction towards acceptable outcomes.
