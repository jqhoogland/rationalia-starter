# Goodhart's Law

**Goodhart's Law** states that when a proxy for some value becomes the target of optimization pressure, the proxy will cease to be a good proxy. One form of Goodhart is demonstrated by the Soviet story of a factory graded on how many shoes they produced (a good proxy for productivity) – they soon began producing a higher number of tiny shoes. Useless, but the numbers look good.

Goodhart's Law is of particular relevance to [AI Alignment](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/ai). Suppose you have something which is generally a good proxy for "the stuff that humans care about", it would be dangerous to have a powerful AI optimize for the proxy, in accordance with Goodhart's law, the proxy will breakdown.  

## Goodhart Taxonomy

In [Goodhart Taxonomy](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy), Scott Garrabrant identifies four kinds of Goodharting:

- Regressional Goodhart - When selecting for a proxy measure, you select not only for the true goal, but also for the difference between the proxy and the goal.
- Causal Goodhart - When there is a non-causal correlation between the proxy and the goal, intervening on the proxy may fail to intervene on the goal.
- Extremal Goodhart - Worlds in which the proxy takes an extreme value may be very different from the ordinary worlds in which the correlation between the proxy and the goal was observed.
- Adversarial Goodhart - When you optimize for a proxy, you provide an incentive for adversaries to correlate their goal with your proxy, thus destroying the correlation with your goal.
