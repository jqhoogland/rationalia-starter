# Neuromorphic AI

A **Neuromorphic AI** ('neuron-shaped') is a form of AI where most of the functionality has been copied from the human brain. This implies that its inner workings are not necessarily understood by the creators any further than is necessary to simulate them on a computer. It is considered a more [unsafe](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Unfriendly_AI) form of AI than either [[Whole Brain Emulation]] or de novo AI because its lacks the high quality replication of human values of the former and the possibility of good theoretical guarantees that the latter may have due to cleaner design.
