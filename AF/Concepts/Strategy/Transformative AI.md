# Transformative AI

**Transformative AI** is "\[…\] AI that precipitates a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution."^[\[1\]](#fnhy8b4kflu8)^ The concept refers to the large effects of AI systems on our well-being, the global economy, state power, international security, etc. and not to specific capabilities that AI might have (unlike the related terms [[Superintelligence|Superintelligent AI]] and [[Artificial General Intelligence]]).

Holden Karnofsky gives a more detailed definition in [another OpenPhil 2016 post](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/some-background-on-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence/):

> \[…\] Transformative AI is anything that fits one or more of the following descriptions (emphasis original):
>
> - AI systems capable of fulfilling all the necessary functions of human scientists, unaided by humans, in developing another technology (or set of technologies) that ultimately becomes widely credited with being the most significant driver of a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution. Note that just because AI systems *could* accomplish such a thing unaided by humans doesn’t mean they *would*; it’s possible that human scientists would provide an important complement to such systems, and could make even faster progress working in tandem than such systems could achieve unaided. I emphasize the hypothetical possibility of AI systems conducting substantial unaided research to draw a clear distinction from the types of AI systems that exist today. I believe that AI systems capable of such broad contributions to the relevant research would likely dramatically accelerate it.
> - AI systems capable of performing tasks that currently (in 2016) account for the majority of full-time jobs worldwide, and/or over 50% of total world wages, unaided and for costs in the same range as what it would cost to employ humans. Aside from the fact that this would likely be sufficient for a major economic transformation relative to today, I also think that an AI with such broad abilities would likely be able to far surpass human abilities in a subset of domains, making it likely to meet one or more of the other criteria laid out here.
> - Surveillance, autonomous weapons, or other AI-centric technology that becomes sufficiently advanced to be the most significant driver of a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution. (This contrasts with the first point because it refers to transformative technology that is itself AI-centric, whereas the first point refers to AI used to speed research on some other transformative technology.)
