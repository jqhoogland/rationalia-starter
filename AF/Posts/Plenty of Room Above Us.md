===Will computers ever be as smart as humans?==
> The best answer to the question, “Will computers ever be as smart as humans?” is probably “Yes, but only briefly.”[1](https://intelligenceexplosion.com/2011/plenty-of-room-above-us/#fn1x12)

==What basis do we have to believe in the possibility of a [[Superintelligence]]?==
- Humans are biologically constrained. AIs aren't. 

==How could an AI surpass human abilities?==
- **Speed**: Transistors are 4 million times faster than axons (6.5 OOMs)
- **Serial depth**: Humans are limited to ~100 sequential steps of computation
- **Computational resources**: Humans are constrained by skull size. AIs by buildings or cities or larger.
- **Rationality**: Humans are far from ideal reasoners
- **Introspective access/editability**. Machines can improve themselves!
