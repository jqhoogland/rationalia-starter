==What makes Recurrent Networks so special?== 
- Vanilla NNs are limited in that they accepted fixed-size inputs & produce fixed-size outputs.
- RNNs allow variable length inputs/outputs.


> If training vanilla neural nets is optimization over functions, training recurrent nets is optimization over programs.


This can be useful even if data is not sequential (where sequential processing is useful).
