> Allan Crossman calls parapsychology [the control group for science](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/1ib/parapsychology_the_control_group_for_science/).

> Parapsychologists are constantly protesting that they are playing by all the standard scientific rules, and yet their results are being ignored – that they are unfairly being held to higher standards than everyone else. I’m willing to believe that. It just means that the standard statistical methods of science are so weak and flawed as to permit a field of study to sustain itself in the complete absence of any subject matter. — Yudkowsky


## Commandments
1. Demand very large **sample size**.

2. Demand **replication**, preferably exact replication, most preferably multiple exact replications.

3. Trust **systematic reviews and meta-analyses** rather than individual studies. Meta-analyses must prove homogeneity of the studies they analyze.

4. Use **Bayesian rather than frequentist** analysis, or even combine both techniques.

5. **Stricter p-value criteria**. It is far too easy to massage p-values to get less than 0.05. Also, make meta-analyses look for “p-hacking” by examining the distribution of p-values in the included studies.

6. Require **pre-registration of trials**.

7. **Address publication bias** by searching for unpublished trials, displaying funnel plots, and using statistics like “fail-safe N” to investigate the possibility of suppressed research.

8. Do **heterogeneity analyses** or at least observe and account for differences in the studies you analyze.

9. Demand **randomized controlled trials**. None of this “correlated even after we adjust for confounders” BS.

10. **Stricter effect size criteria**. It’s easy to get small effect sizes in _anything_.

But then... parapsychologist Bem holds up to all but 6 and 10 of these commandments and still conclude that psychic powers exist.

> _None_ of these commandments even _touch_ poor experimental technique — or confounding, or whatever you want to call it.

> A good Bayesian should be able to say “Well, I got some impressive results, but my prior for psi is very low, so this raises my belief in psi slightly, but raises my belief that the experiments were confounded _a lot_.”

The main weakness is probably that Bem's definition of "replication" is extremely lenient.

> Other than a few very exceptional large medical trials, there is not a study in the world that would survive the level of criticism I am throwing at Bem right now.

E.g.: Wiseman & Schiltz’s [Experimenter Effects And The Remote Detection Of Staring](http://www.richardwiseman.com/resources/staring1.pdf)
- Subject in room alone, hooked up to video link.
- Every so often the experimenter stares at them menacingly through the video link.
- They measure galvanic skin response.
- Schiltz is Psi believer; Wiseman is Psi skeptic. They [[adversarial collaboration|teamed up]] to figure out why they were getting opposite results.
- They find opposite results in their own cohorts with pretty much every variable but the starer being constant. WTF?

At the end of the day though, we end up having to assess the validity of all these results.

Conspiracy: maybe Bem doesn't believe in parapsychology and publishing these results in a Sokalian effort to bring down the perceived credibility of psychology papers.
