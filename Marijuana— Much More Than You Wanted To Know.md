**What are the arguments against legalizing drugs (marijuana)?**


**I. Would Relaxation Of Penalties On Marijuana Increase Marijuana Use?**
- ~~Evidence that states with more liberal laws have more adolescent uses~~ -> this is explained by a third latent variable (hippiness).
- Other studies that compare decriminalization before and after find no increase (instead a decrease)

> Overall I think the evidence is pretty strong that decriminalization probably led to no increase in marijuana use among teens, and may at most have led to a small single-digit increase.

But decriminalized states aren't so different in practice from non-decriminalized states.

Similar results for legalization.

But... isolated papers find increase in hospital admissions post-decriminalization & arrests post medical legalization.

- NL: a 35% increase in marijuana consumption relative to the rest of Europe.
- Portugal: experimentation has increased, but # of addicts hasn't
- Survey of Coloradans about "will you use more" predict ~40% increase
- Economists predict 50%-100% based on price drop

**II. Is Marijuana Bad For You?**
- 9% of users become addicted.
- Currently no increase found in mortality from tar-related effects.
- Heavy use linked to -8 IQ. 
	- This may have been due to confounding factor of poor people's (who use more) IQs being inflated by schooling, then recorrecting.
	- Unclear if this is only true during adolescence.
- MJ use is heavily linked to schizophrenia (as much as 2x).
	- Of course confounders: self-medication, shared cause, etc.
	- There are attempts to determine causal link & a metareview finds a relative risk of 1.4
	- Many different hypotheses.
- Gateway drug?
	- Very difficult to detect? Many alternative explanations.

**III. What Are The Costs Of The Drug War?**

> There are not really that many people in jail for using marijuana.

> Federal numbers are even lower; in the entire federal prison system, they could only find 63 people imprisoned with marijuana possession as the sole crime, and those people were possessing a median of one hundred fifteen _pounds_ of marijuana (enough to make over 100,000 joints).


**IV. An Irresponsible Utilitarian Analysis**

> So here is my guess at the yearly results of marijuana legalization:
>
– 20,000 fewer prisoners (but they might switch to other criminal enterprises)  
– 700,000 fewer arrests  
– $2 billion less in law enforcement costs  
– Some amount of positive gain (let’s say $5 billion) in taxes  
– 4500 fewer road traffic deaths (if you believe the preliminary alcohol substitution numbers)
– 400,000 people with lower IQ  
– $2 billion in social costs from above dumber people  
– 3,200 more cases of schizophrenia a year

> _There is not a sufficiently obvious order-of-magnitude difference between the costs and benefits of marijuana legalization for a evidence-based utilitarian analysis of costs and benefits to inform the debate. You may return to your regularly scheduled wild speculation and shrill accusations._

It comes down almost entirely to traffic deaths.
