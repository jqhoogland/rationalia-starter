# Rationalia

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to your personal guide to [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com), [The Effective Altruism Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/), and [The AI Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/).

This repository is a starting point to take notes on the concepts, terms, jargon, and principles you'll find in the rationality/effective altruism space. It was built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) in mind (as a starter template for a new vault or for your existing vault).

## Motivation

LessWrong and its compatriots have accumulated a lot of posts over the years. This can be daunting for newcomers. Sure you can grind through [The Sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality), but it's going to take a lot more work to actually keep the information in long-term memory.

In particular, the aim of this repository is:

- To get you up to speed with [LessWrong's "concepts"](https://www.lesswrong.com/tags/all) and [Jargon](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/lesswrong-jargon) and with [EA's "topics"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/all).[^0]
- To walk you through [LessWrong's](https://www.lesswrong.com/library), [AF's](https://www.alignmentforum.org/library) and [EA's](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/library) "standard" libraries.

## Structure

This vault consists of note-taking templates[^1] that correspond to published posts. These templates are usually pretty bare (you're the one taking the notes).

What you can expect to find is:

- **Metadata** (tags, external links, authors, etc.)
- Internal (bidirectional) **links**
- A **definition**(s) and flashcard template(s) (occasionally)

## How to Start

- [The AI Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)

[^0]: Each concept note has one or more flashcard templates that you can use to [autogenerate Anki flashcards](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki). We recommend [rewording the provided definition into your own words](https://www.supermemo.com/#Personalize%20and%20provide%20examples).
