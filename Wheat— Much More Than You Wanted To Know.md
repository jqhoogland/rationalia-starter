Why remove wheat? Two typical arguments:
- Carbs are bad.
- Wheat itself is bad.

**Carbs are bad**

> [Low-carbohydrate diets] seem to be [at least as good and maybe a little better](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182351) for weight loss than traditional diets, but this might just be because there are lots of carbohydrates that taste very good and when forced to avoid them, people eat less stuff. They may or may not positively affect metabolic parameters and quality of life. ([1](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11883-009-0069-8), [2](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jc.2002-021480), [3](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=200094), [4](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11136-009-9444-8)). They don’t seem to cause either major health benefits or major health risks in the medium term, which is the longest term for which there is good data available – for example, they have [no effect on cancer rates](http://www.nutritionj.com/content/12/1/58). Overall they seem solid but unspectacular.

**Wheat itself is bad**
- Which compounds? Phytates, lectins, gluten, gliadin, and agglutinin

Concrete claims: 
1. **Some People Without Celiac Disease Are Sensitive To Gluten** – _Mostly true but of limited significance_ %% Official term: "nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS)" %%
2. **Wheat Increases Intestinal Permeability Causing A Leaky Gut** – _Probably true, of uncertain significance_ %% More research needed. %%
3. **Digestion Of Wheat Produces Opiates, Which Get You Addicted To Wheat** – _Probably false, but just true enough to be weird_
4. **Wheat Something Something Something Autism And Schizophrenia** – _Definitely weird_
5. **Wheat Has Been Genetically Modified Recently In Ways That Make It Much Worse For You** – _Probably true, especially if genetically modified means “not genetically modified” and “recently” means “nine thousand years ago”_
6. **The Lectins In Wheat Interfere With Leptin Receptors, Making People Leptin Resistant And Therefore Obese** – _Currently at “mere assertion” level until I hear some evidence_
7. **Wheat Is Actually Super Good For You And You Should Have It All The Time** – _Probably more evidence than the other claims on this list_
