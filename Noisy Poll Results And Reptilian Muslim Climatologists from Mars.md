**Beware of Phantom Lizardmen**

A poll asks people (word-for-word): “Do you believe that shape-shifting reptilian people control our world by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate our society, or not?”

And finds 4% of the US population says yes.

What fraction of these are:
- People who forget which button to press.
- People annoyed at the survey.
- People deliberately fucking with them.
- Etc.

Another possblity is that people support the statement "Obama is the Anti-Christ" as a way of saying "Boo Obama!"

> When we’re talking about very unpopular beliefs, polls can only give a weak signal. Any possible source of noise – jokesters, cognitive biases, or deliberate misbehavior – can easily overwhelm the signal. Therefore, polls that rely on detecting very weak signals should be taken with a grain of salt.
