### Traditional Order
LessWrong typically recommends starting with [[The Sequences]]. 

### Alternative Orders
But as [jimrandomh points out](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JKnLHkKtfpJxPXArd/a-suggested-reading-order-for-less-wrong-2011), there are problems wtih starting with [[The Sequences]]:

> Less Wrong contains over four thousand posts. This is awesome. For newcomers, however, it's quite intimidating. Rather than leave newcomers to figure out which posts are worth reading themselves, we provide some guidance, in the form of suggested reading orders. Previously, this has mainly meant the sequences, which are a list of posts that fit neatly into topics, sorted by topic. Unfortunately, reading in topic-sorted order is less than ideal, and many of Less Wrong's best posts weren't part of any sequence. Therefore, I have put together a suggested reading order: the hundred best posts on Less Wrong, in my purely subjective and unofficial judgment, arranged in a sensible order. Thanks to Student_UK for [pointing out](https://www.lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/66u/rewriting_the_sequences/) the need to reconsider how Less Wrong's archived content is presented, to XiXiDu for [creating a reading list](https://www.lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/66u/rewriting_the_sequences/4cc0) and to Academian for [another reading list](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/User:Academian); my reading list draws on (but is not a strict superset of) both these lists.

jimrandomh was writing in 2011, so the need for suggested reading orders has only gotten more important. 

If you're interested in an alternative order, take a look at the following:
- [[XiXiDu's Order]]
- [[jimrandomh's Order]]
- [[Academian's Order]]
