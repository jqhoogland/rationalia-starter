_**Do not flinch**_, most of LessWrong can be read and understood by people with a previous level of education less than secondary school. (And [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) followed by [BetterExplained](http://betterexplained.com/) plus the help of Google and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) ought to be enough to let anyone read anything directed at the scientifically literate.) Most of these references aren't prerequisite, and only a small fraction are pertinent to any particular post on LessWrong. Do not be intimidated, just go ahead and start reading the [Sequences](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences) if all this sounds too long. It's much easier to understand than this list makes it look like.

Nevertheless, as it says in the **[Twelve Virtues of Rationality](http://yudkowsky.net/rational/virtues)**, [scholarship is a virtue](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/3m3/the_neglected_virtue_of_scholarship/), and in particular:

> It is especially important to eat math and science which impinges upon rationality: [Evolutionary psychology](http://www.hplusmagazine.com/articles/bio/darwinian-psychologist-straw-mans-ass-kicked), [heuristics and biases](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/#CHB), [social psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology), [probability theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/#Probability), [decision theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/#DT).

## LessWrong.com

This list is hosted on [LessWrong.com](https://www.lesswrong.com/), a community blog _devoted to refining the art of human [rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/31/what_do_we_mean_by_rationality) - the art of thinking_. If you follow the links below you'll learn more about this community. It is one of the most important resources you'll ever come across if your aim is to **get what _you_ want**, if you want **_to win_**. It shows you that there is more to most things than meets the eye, but more often than not much less than you think. It shows you that even smart people can be completely wrong but that most people are [_not even wrong_](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/2un/references_resources_for_lesswrong/#Epistemology). It teaches you to be careful in what you emit and to be skeptical of what you receive. It doesn't tell you what is right, it teaches you how to think and to become _less wrong_. And to do so is in your own self interest because it helps you **to attain your goals**, it helps you to**achieve what you want**.

## **Artificial Intelligence**

> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra-intelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an "intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. — I.

## **Heuristics and Biases**

> One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision. — Bertrand Russell

> Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge. — Charles Darwin

The [**heuristics and biases**](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Heuristics_and_biases) program in cognitive psychology tries to work backward from [biases](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Biases) (experimentally reproducible human errors) to [heuristics](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Heuristic) (the underlying mechanisms at work in the brain).

## **Mathematics**

**Learning Mathematics**

> Here's a phenomenon I was surprised to find: you'll go to talks, and hear various words, whose definitions you're not so sure about. At some point you'll be able to make a sentence using those words; you won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the sentence is correct. You'll also be able to ask a question using those words. You still won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the question is interesting, and you'll want to know the answer. Then later on, you'll learn what the words mean more precisely, and your sense of how they fit together will make that learning much easier. The reason for this phenomenon is that mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.) — [Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html)

> Probabilities express uncertainty, and it is only agents who can be uncertain. A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory. Ignorance is in the mind. — Eliezer Yudkowsky

Math is fundamental, not just for LessWrong. But especially Bayes’ Theorem is essential to understand the reasoning underlying most of the writings on LW.

> All the limitative theorems of metamathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally.

## **Decision theory**

> It is precisely the notion that Nature does not care about our algorithm, which frees us up to pursue the winning Way - without attachment to any particular ritual of cognition, apart from our belief that it wins. Every rule is up for grabs, except the rule of winning. — Eliezer Yudkowsky

Remember that any heuristic is bound to certain circumstances. If you want X from agent Y and the rule is that Y only gives you X if you are a devoted irrationalist then ¬irrational. Under certain circumstances what is irrational may be rational and what is rational may be irrational. Paul K. Feyerabend said: "All methodologies have their limitations and the only ‘rule’ that survives is ‘anything goes’."

## **Computer science**

> The introduction of suitable abstractions is our only mental aid to organize and master complexity. — Edsger W. Dijkstra

One of the fundamental premises on LessWrong is [that a universal computing device can simulate every physical process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing%E2%80%93Deutsch_principle) and that we therefore should be able to [reverse engineer the human brain](http://xixidu.net/2009/08/21/reverse-engineering-the-brain-astrocytes-microtubule/) as it is fundamentally computable. That is, [intelligence](http://www.vetta.org/definitions-of-intelligence/) and [consciousness](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/) are substrate-neutral.

**Quantum physics**

> An electron is not a billiard ball, and it’s not a crest and trough moving through a pool of water. An electron is a mathematically different sort of entity, all the time and under all circumstances, and it has to be accepted on its own terms. The universe is not wavering between using particles and waves, unable to make up its mind. It’s only human intuitions about QM that swap back and forth. — Eliezer Yudkowsky

> I am not going to tell you that quantum mechanics is weird, bizarre, confusing, or alien. QM is counterintuitive, but that is a problem with your intuitions, not a problem with quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has been around for billions of years before the Sun coalesced from interstellar hydrogen. Quantum mechanics was here before you were, and if you have a problem with that, you are the one who needs to change. QM sure won’t. There are no surprising facts, only models that are surprised by facts; and if a model is surprised by the facts, it is no credit to that model. — Eliezer Yudkowsky
