# How to Start

The [[Reading Orders]] page lists a few different ways you might want to approach the curriculum.

- Start with [[Highlights from the Sequences (Collection)|the highlighted posts]] (recommended).
- Read through [[Rationalityâ€” A-Z|The Sequences]], [[HPMOR]], & [[The Codex]].
- Follow one of alternative [[Reading Orders]] proposed by various LessWrong readers over the years.
- Look up a relevant [[Concepts|concept]] and move on from there.

All of LessWrong's content depends on all the other content, so there isn't one correct way to go through everything. Just try stuff out. [[Steelmanning Divination|Embrace randomness]] and tap the random button to work your way through the content as the pseudo-random number generators wish it.
