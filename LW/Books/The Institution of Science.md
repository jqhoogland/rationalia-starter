The institution of Science is the greatest producer of knowledge humanity has ever built. But how reliable is this institution, and how powerful are its methods? The second book in The Codex tries to learn what science knows about a variety of important questions, and also tries to understand where science goes wrong, building up a number of general heuristics about reading academic papers along the way.
