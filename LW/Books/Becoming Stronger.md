How can individuals and communities put all this into practice? These three sequences begin with an autobiographical account of Yudkowskyâ€™s own biggest philosophical blunders, with advice on how he thinks others might do better. The book closes with recommendations for developing evidence-based applied rationality curricula, and for forming groups and institutions to support interested students, educators, researchers, and friends.
