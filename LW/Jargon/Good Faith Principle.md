# Good Faith Principle

A principle of productive debate which states that, in any given disagreement, it is best to assume that all agents are acting in good faith, are seeking actual resolution, and want good things for all involved parties and the world. The Good Faith Principle may be applied interpersonally, as in [[Double-Crux|Double Crux]], or intrapersonally, as in Propagating Urges.
