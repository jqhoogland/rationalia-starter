From Gendlin's Focusing, a general term for one's overall physiological and emotional response to a given person, domain, or topic.  e.g. "when I think about my looming deadline, I get a strong, doomy *felt sense* that partially expresses itself as this heavy feeling in my shoulders."  See also "handle."
