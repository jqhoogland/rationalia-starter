# Metacognitive Blindspot



An area of one’s self-reflection or introspection which does not exist or returns inaccurate results, such as one’s internal sense of how capable one is of driving safely after a few drinks. Because metacognitive blindspots are derived from flaws in introspection, they often “hide their own existence,” such that, upon asking yourself whether or not you have one, you find yourself thinking “no.”
