# Sphexishness

Often thought of as the opposite of agency; the execution of rigid algorithms which create the appearance (but not the advantages) of intelligent thought or action. Based upon the [behaviors of the sphex wasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphex#Uses_in_philosophy), which seems to take reasoned, critical action during its search for food, but is in fact simply chaining together strings of simple trigger-action patterns.
