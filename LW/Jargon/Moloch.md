A shorthand for “things that go wrong despite the lack of any malicious intent,” usually in the context of systems and social dynamics. Moloch is a personified metaphor for tragedies-of-the-commons, prisoners’ dilemmas, Red Queen races, and all other situations in which local incentives lead to global disaster, first coined in an essay by Scott Alexander in 2014.
