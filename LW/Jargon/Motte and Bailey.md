> Somebody says God doesnâ€™t exist. Another person objects that God is just a name for the order and beauty in the universe. Then this somehow helps defend the position that God is a supernatural creator being. How does that even happen?

Certain medieval castles would have:

- **Bailey**: a field of desirable land
- **Motte**: a tower in the middle to serve as defensive fall-back position

As "doctrine", motte-and-bailey refers to making a bold, controversial statement, then retreating to the obvious, uncontroversial statement at the first sign of challenge.

It's the mirror-image of [[Steelmanning|Weakmanning]] (which is replacing a strong position with a weak position).
