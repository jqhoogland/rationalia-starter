# Stag Hunt



A game theory problem similar to the prisoners' dilemma, in which a number of people must choose together whether to "hunt stag" (i.e. coordinate on a costly effort with a high likelihood of a large reward) or "hunt rabbit" (i.e. each engage in a much less costly activity with a high likelihood of a much smaller reward).  If most of the group chooses stag but one person chooses rabbit, then everyone who chose stag pays the high cost but no one receives the large reward.
