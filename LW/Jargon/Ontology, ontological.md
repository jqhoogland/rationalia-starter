# Ontology/ontological

 The philosophical study of the nature of being, existence, or reality, deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences. See also [ontological argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument) at Wikipedia for an example of (ab)using ontology to try and prove the existence of God.
