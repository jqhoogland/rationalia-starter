# Bug

A negative emotion or outcome (assumed to be solvable) that results from one’s current habits, beliefs, or ways of being, or an unfulfilled potential (assumed to be achievable) regarding one’s well-being, abilities, or position in life. Often bugs can be thought of metaphorically as “glitches” in a computer program—one is pursuing one’s goals according to processes that mostly work, but there are unexpected or unpleasant side-effects.
