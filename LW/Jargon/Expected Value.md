# Expected Value



Often abbreviated “EV,” this is the amount of some good (“value”) one mathematically expects given an appropriately weighted average of the possible outcomes of an uncertain situation. For instance, if on a fair coin toss you will gain $4 for each heads but lose $2 for each tails, then the EV of this situation is $1. That is to say, after taking many such bets, you should expect to gain on average $1 per coin toss.
