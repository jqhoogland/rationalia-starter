# ITT



Ideological Turing Test.  The ability to restate an opposing viewpoint sufficiently well that a neutral observer listening to both you and your conversational partner would be at least 50% likely to guess that you truly held that position.  Often requested in debate or disagreement, i.e. "would you be willing to try to pass my ITT?" meaning "would you be willing to try to state your model of my position in a way you believe I would endorse as accurate and charitable?"
