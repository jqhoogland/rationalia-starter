The study and practice of thinking and acting in concert with reality, sometimes divided into epistemic and instrumental rationality. Epistemic rationality is concerned with the formation of true beliefs, and instrumental rationality with taking actions that are likely to bring about one’s desired outcomes; under some formulations of rationality, both are seen as emerging from the same core quality.
