# Epistemics

The construction of formal models of the processes by which knowledge and understanding are achieved and communicated. Similar to [[epistemology]] (the philosophical theory of knowledge), epistemics is a field concerned with what we know, and how we know that we know it. CFAR participants and instructors will often distinguish between “good and bad epistemics,” by which they mean beliefs and thought processes that are well-justified and closely matched to reality versus those that are not.
