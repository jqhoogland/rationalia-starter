From Gendlin's Focusing, a general term for the explicit label or description that resonates with one's felt sense. e.g. "there's this floating, expansive feeling in my chest, and it's because I am *finally free."*  In this example, "finally free" would be the handle, where the floating, expansive feelings in the chest would be the felt sense.
