# CoZE



Comfort zone exploration, a technique in which fears and aversions are tested under limited, safe circumstances such that experience and evidence can be used to evaluate their validity. CoZE is related to exposure therapy, in which aversions are reduced or excised through gradual and repeated exposure, but is meaningfully different in that it does not take for granted that a given aversion is inappropriate. The goal of CoZE is to build a more *accurate* set of anticipations, such that one feels averse only to actions which present actual dangers or difficulties, and not to those which merely *seem* hazardous.
