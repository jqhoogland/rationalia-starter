# ITC

Immunity To Change, a framework developed by Lisa Lahey and Robert Kegan used for addressing bugs and problems that have been sticky and difficult-to-shift.  When engaging in ITC, participants list out desired behaviors that they would see if they had successfully solved their problem, blocking behaviors that they currently engage in, conflicting values that those blocking behaviors are trying to protect, underlying world models or beliefs about causality which put the blocking behaviors and desired behaviors into conflict, and possible experiments to test whether those conflicts are, in fact, inescapable.
