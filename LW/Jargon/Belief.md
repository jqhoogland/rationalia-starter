An explicit opinion or belief, sometimes called a "profession," expressible in words. Sometimes contradictory to one’s anticipations, which are intuitive, felt beliefs—for instance, one might anticipate/alieve that a high wooden bridge over a canyon is dangerous, and tense and move gingerly, but if one professes/believes that the bridge is, in fact, safe, one will still walk across it without much hesitation.
