# *Conversation Halter*

This term was introduced on LessWrong by Eliezer in the [eponymous post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wqmmv6NraYv4Xoeyj/conversation-halters):

> *While working on my book, I found in passing that I'd developed a list of what I started out calling "stonewalls", but have since decided to refer to as "conversation halters".  These tactics of argument are distinguished by their being attempts to cut off the flow of debate - which is rarely the wisest way to think, and should certainly rate an alarm bell.*
