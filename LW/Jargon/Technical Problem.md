# Technical Problem

A problem where the path toward the solution is clear, involving known or knowable processes. While technical problems may be extremely complex or difficult, the difficulty is in executing the solution, rather than in discovering it. Contrast with “[[adaptive problem|adaptive probl%%%%ems]],” which contain unknown unknowns and often require a novel approach.
