A classic problem in game theory in which agents are locally incentivized to take action which, if performed by all agents, leads to a globally worse outcome.  Two prisoners, each unable to communicate with the other, are offered the following choice: to *defect* on the other prisoner, giving information to their captors in exchange for a lighter sentence, or to *cooperate* with the other prisoner, keeping their mouths shut.  If both prisoners cooperate, they each receive a moderate sentence (e.g. two years).  If both defect, they each receive a harsh sentence (e.g. five years).  However, if one defects and the other does not, the defector receives a light sentence (e.g. one year) while the cooperator receives a harsh sentence (e.g. five years).
