# Affordance

An opportunity or potential-for-action arising from a given context; a door handle creates an *affordance* for pulling. In particular, it is a *genuine* or *felt* opportunity—while there may be no physical difference between picking up a pen on one’s own desk, one’s coworker’s desk, one’s manager’s desk, or the CEO’s desk, each of those contexts provides a different degree of affordance.
