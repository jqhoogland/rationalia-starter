# Polaris

A shorthand for “the ultimate goal” or “the guiding principle.” Typically referenced as a check to confirm that a given plan of action is, in fact, likely to move one toward one’s true terminal goals (“are you keeping your eyes on Polaris?”). See also “[[Something to Protect (Post)]]” and [[Polaris, Five-Second Versions, and Thought Lengths]]
