# Subject-Object Shift

A change in one's orientation to some problem, feeling, dynamic, or situation, in which one shifts from being *subject to* whatever's happening, to being able to *take it as object.* When a small child drops their ice cream cone, the resulting disappointment is often all-consuming; they are subject to it.  When an adult drops their ice cream cone, they are often able to contextualize and "be larger than" their disappointment, taking it as object.
