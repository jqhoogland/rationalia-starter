# Bayesian Updating



A method of shifting belief in response to new evidence, derived from Bayes’ Theorem in statistics. Formal Bayesian updating requires use of a mathematical formula, but a rough, approximate version involves stating an explicit belief with a given probability (a “prior”), evaluating the degree to which new evidence bears upon that belief, and making an incremental adjustment to one’s evaluation of its likelihood in response, resulting in a “posterior” that is meaningfully different.
