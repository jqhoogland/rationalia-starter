# Blindsight



Classically, an effect whereby individuals with certain types of blindness can nevertheless “see” in the sense that their unconscious mind is processing information that they are not consciously aware of. These individuals can correctly identify the position of lit dots on a black screen by “guessing,” at a rate far higher than chance would allow. Metaphorically, blindsight is used to refer to instinctive or visceral knowledge that tends to be more correct than one would expect, thanks to accurate processing by one’s subconscious processes.
