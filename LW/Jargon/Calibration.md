# Calibration



The process of causing one’s beliefs and expectations to match reality, most often expressed probabilistically (e.g. “If you look at all of the times I say I’m 75% sure, I’m right three out of four.”).  Usually, calibration is treated as a skill, and practiced explicitly, as by spending a month making hundreds of predictions and seeing how many of them turned out as you thought they would.
