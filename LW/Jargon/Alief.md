A deeply-felt belief, sometimes called an “anticipation,” emerging naturally from one’s mental model of the universe. Sometimes contradictory to one’s *professions*, which are explicitly stated beliefs—for instance, one might profess/believe that a high wooden bridge over a canyon is entirely safe, and yet reveal an anticipation/alief of danger by tensing, moving gingerly, and refusing to look down.
