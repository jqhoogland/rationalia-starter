# Ben Goertzel

**Ben Goertzel** is the Chairman at the AGI company Novamente, and founder of the AGI conference series.

Goertzel held the title of "Director of Research" at the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI)|Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] in 2008 while SI and Novamente funded the AI project [OpenCog](http://opencog.org/). Goertzel is currently an advisor for SI. He notably disagrees with SI's arguments regarding the need for [Friendly AI](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_AI).

Goertzel has responded to [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]'s [[Coherent Extrapolated Volition]] with his own variation of the idea, [[Coherent Aggregated Volition]].
