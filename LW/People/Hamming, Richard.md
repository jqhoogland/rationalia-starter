# Hamming, Richard

A scientist at Bell Laboratories in the mid-twentieth century, and generator of the [[Hamming Question]], paraphrased as “what is the most important problem facing me in this moment, and what are the things that are keeping me from working on it?” At CFAR, instructors and participants will often form “Hamming circles” to help one another articulate and solve “Hamming problems,” in answer to that question.
