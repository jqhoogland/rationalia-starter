# Coordination

*"Indeed. Moving from bad equilibria to better equilibria is the whole point of having a civilization in the first place."*

Coordination is the ability of multiple agents to work together.

This is the difficult question of how to work with other agents in the world, and how to have healthy reasoning and decision-making processes within a group.

If many agents in a group are working on different projects, how do we decide on resource allocation between those projects? If many agents in a group believe different theories about some subject like chemistry or machine learning, how do we use that information to inform our own beliefs about these topics? If many agents in a group want different things, how do we set collective priorities?

These are all deep questions that functional groups must answer, and this book will explore.
