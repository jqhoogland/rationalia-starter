# The Methods of Rationality

Harry: You can't DO that!

Minerva McGonagall: It's only a transfiguration; an animagus transformation, to be exact—

Harry: You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule – rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signaling! And cats are COMPLICATED! How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?

Minerva: Magic.

Harry: Magic isn't enough to do that! You'd have to be a god!

—Harry's first encounter with magic
