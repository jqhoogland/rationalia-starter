# Probability and Predictions

Nearly everyone is very very very overconfident. We know this from [experiments](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baruch_Fischhoff/publication/230726569_Knowing_with_certainty_the_appropriateness_of_extreme_confidence/links/00b4952b854b29281c000000.pdf) where people answer true/false trivia questions, then are asked to state how confident they are in their answer. If people’s confidence was well-calibrated, someone who said they were 99% confident (ie only 1% chance they’re wrong) would get the question wrong only 1% of the time. In fact, people who say they are 99% confident get the question wrong about 20% of the time.

It gets worse. People who say there’s only a 1 in 100,000 chance they’re wrong? Wrong 15% of the time. One in a million? Wrong 5% of the time. They’re not just overconfident, they are *fifty thousand times* as confident as they should be.
