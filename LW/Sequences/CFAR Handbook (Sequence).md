# CFAR Handbook

The Center for Applied Rationality set out to develop simple, concrete concepts and techniques that could be straightforwardly applied to anyone's problems and goals, (hopefully) resulting in clearer thinking, better decision-making, and better follow-through.  

This is the result of the first five years or so of that research and development.
