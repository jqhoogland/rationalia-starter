# Living Luminously

[Luminosity](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Luminosity), as used here, is self-awareness. A luminous mental state is one that you have and know that you have. It could be an [emotion](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Emotion), a [belief](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Belief) or [alief](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Alief), a disposition, a [quale](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/index.php?title=Qualia&action=edit&redlink=1), a memory - anything that might happen or be stored in your brain. What's going on in your head?
