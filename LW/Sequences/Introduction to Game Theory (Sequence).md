# Introduction to Game Theory

This sequence of posts is a primer on game theory intended at an introductory level. Because it is introductory, Less Wrong veterans may find some parts boring, obvious, or simplistic - although hopefully nothing is so simplistic as to be outright wrong.

Parts of this sequence draw heavily upon material from *[The Art of Strategy](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Strategy-Theorists-Business/dp/0393062430)* by Avinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff, and it may in part be considered a (very favorable) review of the book accompanied by an exploration of its content. I have tried to include enough material to be useful, but not so much material that it becomes a plagiarism rather than a review (it's probably a bad idea to pick a legal fight with people who write books called *The Art of Strategy*.) Therefore, for the most complete and engaging presentation of this material, I highly recommend the original book.

Special thanks to Luke for his book recommendation and his strong encouragement to write this.
