# Three Worlds Collide

> "The kind of classic fifties-era first-contact story that Jonathan Swift might have written, if Jonathan Swift had had a background in game theory."
>       \-\- (Hugo nominee) Peter Watts, "[In Praise of Baby-Eating](http://www.rifters.com/crawl/?p=266)"



*Three Worlds Collide* is a story I wrote to illustrate some points on naturalistic metaethics and diverse other issues of rational conduct.  It grew, as such things do, into a small novella.  On publication, it proved widely popular and widely criticized.  Be warned that the story, as it wrote itself, ended up containing some profanity and PG-13 content.
