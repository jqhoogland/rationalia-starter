# Replacing Guilt

> My goal is to help people remove guilt-based motivation entirely, and replace it with intrinsic motivation. I'm aiming to both reduce the frequency of Netflix binges *and* reduce the bad feelings that follow. I'm aiming to help people feel like they're still worthwhile human beings if they stop working before they literally drop.

A sequence about replacing guilt with other feelings and finding better ways to self-motivate, so that you can build a better future without falling apart in the process.

> When all is said and done, Nature will not judge us by our actions; we will be measured only by what *actually happens.* Our goal, in the end, is to ensure that the timeless history of our universe is one that is filled with whatever it is we're fighting for. For me, at least, this is the underlying driver that takes the place of guilt: Once we have learned our lessons from the past, there is no reason to wrack ourselves with guilt. All we need to do, in any given moment, is look upon the actions available to us, consider, and take whichever one seems most likely to lead to a future full of light.
