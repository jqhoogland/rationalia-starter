# Fun Theory

A concrete theory of transhuman values. How much fun is there in the universe? Will we ever run out of fun? Are we having fun yet? Could we be having more fun? Part of the [complexity of value](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value) thesis.

Also forms part of the fully general answer to religious theodicy.

Sequence by [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/eliezer_yudkowsky), imported from [the wiki](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Fun_Theory_Sequence). Overlaps with [[Value Theory]].
