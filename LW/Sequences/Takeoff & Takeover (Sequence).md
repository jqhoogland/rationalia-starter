# Takeoff & Takeover

> Imagine an advanced society, with complex structures more intricate and intelligent than anything that exists today – a society which nevertheless lacks any being that is conscious, or whose welfare has moral significance. In a sense, this would be an uninhabited society. It would be a society of economic miracles and technological awesomeness, with nobody there to benefit. A Disneyland with no children.
