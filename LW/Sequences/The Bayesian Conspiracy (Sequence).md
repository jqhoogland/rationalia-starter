# The Bayesian Conspiracy

The _beisutsukai_ are members of a secret society, also known as the Bayesian Conspiracy.

Derived from "beisu", a Japanese transliteration of Bayes (though more accurate Japanese pronunciation would be bei-zu, not bei-su), plus "tsukai", Japanese "user", therefore "Bayes-user". A casual, shortened pronunciation would probably come out "bayes-tskai".
