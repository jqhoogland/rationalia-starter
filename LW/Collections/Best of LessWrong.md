# Best of LessWrong

Each December since 2018, the LessWrong community comes together to look at the best posts from the *previous year*, and reflect on which of them have stood the test of time. We hold 2-month-long annual review process. At the end, the thousands of posts from a given year are narrowed down into approximately 50 posts.

Those posts are collected in these Best Of LessWrong sequences. If you'd like to get a sense of what intellectual work LessWrong has done in the past few years, this is a good place to start.
