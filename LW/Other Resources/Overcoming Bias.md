# Overcoming Bias

[**Overcoming Bias**](http://www.overcomingbias.com) is a personal blog by [[Robin Hanson]] on why we believe and do what we do, why we pretend otherwise, how we might do better, and what our descendents might do, if they don't all die". Prior to the founding of LessWrong in 2009, Overcoming Bias was a group blog, with most posts coming from Robin Hanson and Eliezer Yudkowsky; Eliezer and other contributors moved to LessWrong.
