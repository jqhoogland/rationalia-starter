# Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

The **Lottery Ticket Hypothesis** claims that neural networks used in [machine learning](machine-learning) get most of their performance from sub-networks that are already present at initialization that approximate the final policy ("winning tickets"). The training process would, under this model, work by increasing weight on the lottery ticket sub-network and reducing weight on the rest of the network.

The hypothesis was proposed in [a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf) by Jonathan Frankle and Micheal Carbin of MIT CSAIL.
