Careful use of language dictates that we distinguish between several senses in which something can be said to be impossible. Some things are logically impossible: you can't have a square circle or an object that is both perfectly black and perfectly not-black. Also, in our [reductionist](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/reductionism) universe operating according to [universal physical laws](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/universal-law), some things are physically impossible based on our model of how things work, even they are not [obviously](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mind-projection-fallacy) contradictory or contrary to reason: for example, the laws of thermodynamics give us a strong guarantee that there can never be a perpetual motion machine.

It can be tempting to label as impossible very difficult problems which you have no idea how to solve. But the apparent lack of a solution is not a strong guarantee that no solution can exist in the way that the laws of thermodynamics, or Godel's incompleteness results, give us proofs that something can not be accomplished. A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory; in the absence of a proof that a problem is insolvable, you can't be confident that you're not just overlooking something that a [greater intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/artificial-general-intelligence) would spot in an instant.
