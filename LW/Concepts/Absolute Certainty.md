# Absolute Certainty

Possessing **absolute certainty** in a fact, or [[Bayesian Probability|Bayesian probability]] of 1, isn't a good idea. Losing an epistemic bet made with absolute certainty corresponds to receiving infinite negative payoff, according to the logarithmic [[Scoring Rule|proper scoring rule]].

The same principle applies to mathematical truths. Not possessing absolute certainty in math doesn't make the math itself uncertain, the same way that an [[The Map Is Not The Territory|uncertain map]] doesn't cause the territory to blur out. The world, and the math, are precise, while knowledge about them is incomplete.

The impossibility of justified absolute certainty is sometimes used as a [[Rationalization|rationalization]] for the [[Fallacy of Gray|fallacy of gray]].
