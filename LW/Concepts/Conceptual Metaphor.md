# Conceptual Metaphor

In contemporary linguistics and cognitive science, **conceptual metaphors** are neurally-implemented mappings between concrete [domains of discourse](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/domain_of_discourse) (often related to our body and perception) and more abstract domains. These are a well-known source of [[Bias|bias]] and are often exploited in the [[Dark Arts]].

The conceptual metaphor "ARGUMENT is WAR" is frequently discussed at Less Wrong, since it is at the core of the Western [adversarial system](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/adversarial_system) of debate. It is reflected in such statements as "I *won* that argument", "His position is *indefensible*", "He *shot down* my claim", "His criticisms were *right on target*" and the like.

Similarly, [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff) has documented the effect of political metaphors, which tend to map government to a "nurturing mother" or an "authoritarian father".
