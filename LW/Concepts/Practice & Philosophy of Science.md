**Practice and Philosophy of Science** is for posts that discuss how science is done or should be done; examples include [[Building Intuitions On Non-Empirical Arguments In Science|Building Intuitions on Non-Empirical Arguments in Science]] and the [Science and Rationality sequence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fxynfGCSHpY4FmBZy). (It is not for posts that simply report on a new scientific result.)
