**Rational evidence** is the broadest possible sense of [[Evidence|evidence]], i.e., the [Bayesian](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism) sense. Rational evidence about a hypothesis H is *any* observation which has a different [likelihood](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/likelihood) depending on whether H holds in reality or not.

Rational evidence is distinguished from narrower forms of evidence, such as scientific evidence or legal evidence. For a belief to be scientific, you should be able to do repeatable experiments to verify the belief. For evidence to be admissible in court, it must e.g. be a personal observation rather than hearsay.

For example, suppose I tell you that the original author of this paragraph wore white socks while writing it. (In fact, I do so tell you.) You now have *rational evidence* that the author of this paragraph wore white socks, because I'm more likely to tell you this if I am wearing white socks, than if I'm not (Note: This doesn't prove that I am wearing white socks; this is why it is 'evidence'). But it is not *scientific knowledge* because there is no experiment you can do for yourself to verify whether it is true. And it is not *legal evidence* \- you could testify in court that I had *told* you my socks were white, but you could not testify that my socks were white.

The [scientific method](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/science) can be viewed as a special standard of admissible evidence protecting a pool of extra-strong beliefs. Conversely, a fact can be rationally guessable without it generating the specially strong evidence which would qualify knowledge of the fact as "scientific". Just as a police detective may rationally know the identity of the local crime boss without having the special evidence needed to prove it *in court*.
