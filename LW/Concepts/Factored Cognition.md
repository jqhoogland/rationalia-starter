**Factored cognition** is an approach to artificial intelligence where sophisticated learning and reasoning is broken down (or factored) into many small and mostly independent tasks \[[1](https://ought.org/research/factored-cognition)\].

Factored Cognition is related to [*Iterated Amplification* (IDA)](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/iterated-amplification).
