# Reductionism (Sequence)

How to take reality apart into piecesâ€¦ and live in that universe, where we have always lived, without feeling disappointed about the fact that complicated things are made of simpler things.

Definitely one of the core LW sequences. Written by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], ran from 08 Mar 2008 to 05 Apr 2008, with scattered other posts elsewhere.

Items in italic are potentially skippable; items in bold are extra-important.
