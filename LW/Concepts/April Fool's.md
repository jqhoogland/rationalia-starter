# April Fool's

An annual event in the US, which could be thought of as "Notice Your Surprise" day.Â 

*Special rule for this tag: Please don't add entries to this tag during April Fool's, to not spoil all the surprise as soon as people see the top of the post, but feel free to add any old April Fool's jokes starting on the 2nd.*
