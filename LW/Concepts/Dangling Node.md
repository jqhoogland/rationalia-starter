A label for something that isn't "actually real".

Tree in a forest example
------------------------

* "If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?"

* Asking whether or not it creates sound waves is asking about a "real node".

* Asking whether or not it produces firing in someone's auditory cortex is asking about a "real node".

* Asking about whether or not it "really makes a sound" is asking about a Dangling Node.
