# Internal Family Systems

**Internal Family Systems**, or IFS, is a family therapy-descended model of the psyche and psychotherapy method based on the idea that the mind is split between *parts* called *exiles*, *managers*, and *firefighters*. Therapy consists of methods for allowing these parts to "talk" to each other so, for example, exiles can be reintegrated.

[Building up to an Internal Family Systems model](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model) offers a more thorough introduction to the IFS model.

For a related technique developed by CFAR, see [[Internal Double Crux]]. Rather than thinking of the mind as an entity with one set of goals and beliefs, IFS includes many independently acting components, each of which might have varying goals and beliefs; see [[Subagents|subagents]] for the more general form of this idea.
