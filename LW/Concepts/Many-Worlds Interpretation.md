Standard [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanics]] is made of two parts: a part that describes the unitary and deterministic evolution of a state vector, and a part that describes how a state vector randomly collapses when subjected to "measurement".  
The **many-worlds interpretation** (MWI) [cuts away](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/occam-s-razor) the latter part. It uses [[Decoherence|decoherence]] to explain how the universe splits into many separate branches, each of which looks like it came out of a random collapse.
