# Chesterton's Fence

**Chesterton's Fence** is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood.

*Related*: [[Humility|Epistemic Modesty]]

From Chesterton’s 1929 book, The Thing, in the chapter entitled *The Drift from Domesticity* \[1\]:

> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.
