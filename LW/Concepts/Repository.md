# Repository

**Repositories** are pages that are meant to collect information and advice of a specific type or area from the LW community.Â 

They are similar to but distinct from [[List of Links]] pages, which focus on collecting existing resources (either LW articles or external) rather than collecting advice & data directly from participants.
