# Happiness

Posts about **Happiness**. one of the tricky things about Happiness is that sometimes directly pursuing it doesn't work or is even counterproductive. Happiness isn't (and can't be) [the only important thing](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/synsRtBKDeAFuo7e3/not-for-the-sake-of-happiness-alone), but is non the less important. Thus LessWrong dealt a lot with the questions about happiness and how to pursue it.
