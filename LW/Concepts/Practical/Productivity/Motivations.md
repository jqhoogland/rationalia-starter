# Motivations

**Motivations** are the reasons why we think and do the things that we do. Related: **Desire, Values**. Many questions can asked about motivation such as: i) what does/could/should motivate people? ii) which stated motivations are true motivations for belief and behavior? iii) which motivations are *valid* vs *invalid*? iv) How does motivation even work?

- **Rationalization** is the act of finding reasons to support a desired conclusion rather than reasoning in ways which reach the true conclusion.
- **Motivated Cognition** is when one's thinking does not purely follow processes for generating truth, and are instead influenced by desires/motivation to reach certain conclusion.

## Motivation and Belief

In the context of belief, a valid motivation for believing something might be having encountered Bayesian evidence for it; in contrast, simply wishing something were true is a poor motivation for believing and often results *motivated reasoning \[link need\].*

The Litanies of Gendlin and Tarsky \[links\] are often invoked to elicit feels which motivate truth-seeking behaviors.

## Stated Vs Actual Motivation

It is no secret that often the reasons people give for their actions and beliefs are probably not the real ones driving their behavior. Is that your real objection? The work of Hanson….Signaling…

## The Cognitive Science of Motivation

While most people can recognize the feeling of motivation, it is a much more complication question on how agents, particularly humans, implement *motivation.*

Related to the question of Motivation is subagents. Is one's overall self actually made up of subagents each with their own desires. Kaj Sotala explores this in his Multiagent Theories of Mind Sequences. CFAR techniques: Internal Double Crux are aimed harmonizing between the desires/motivations of different "parts" of oneself.
