# Virtues

**Virtues** are traits that one *ought* to possess, for the benefit of the world or oneself.

On LessWrong the focus is often on epistemic virtues, as in Eliezer Yudowsky's essay **[[Twelve Virtues of Rationality|Twelve Virtues of Rationality]]** which offers this list of virtues (roughly summarized):

- **[[Curiosity|Curiosity]]** \- the burning desire to pursue truth;
- **Relinquishment** \- not being attached to mistaken beliefs;
- **Lightness** \- updating your beliefs with ease;
- **[[Evenness|Evenness]]** \- not privileging particular hypotheses in the pursuit of truth;
- **Argument** \- the will to let one's beliefs be challenged;
- **[[Empiricism|Empiricism]]** \- grounding oneself in observation and prediction;
- **[[Occam's Razor|Simplicity]]** \- elimination of unnecessary detail in modeling the world;
- **[[Humility|Humility]]** \- recognition of one's fallibility;
- **[[Perfectionism|Perfectionism]]** \- seeking perfection even if it's not attainable;
- **Precision** \- seeking narrower statements and not overcorrect;
- **[[Scholarship & Learning|Scholarship]]** \- the study of multiple domains and perspectives;
- [**The nameless virtue**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/twelfth-virtue) \- seeking truth and not the virtues for themselves.
