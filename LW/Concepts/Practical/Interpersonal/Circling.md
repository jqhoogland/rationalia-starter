# Circling

**Circling** is a group "meditative", "relational" practice. Typically, a group of people sit in a circle and deliberately focus their attention the emotions and experiences of each participant in the group. Communication is usually restricted to the topic of what the individuals in the Circle are experiencing in the present moment, particular their attitudes, feelings, and reactions to others in the group.

Circling may offer benefits in greater awareness of oneself, others, and the interpersonal dynamics between the two. Since social relations are so key to human wellbeing and at the heart of so many psychological challenges, Circling can be of key interest to anyone trying optimize themselves. It may also foster better relationships and cooperation with others.

However, Circling originated outside the LessWrong community and many feel that the practice does not have sufficient evidence behind it for it to so widely admired within the Rationalist community.
