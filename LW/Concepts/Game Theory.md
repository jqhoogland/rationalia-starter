# Game Theory

**Game theory** is the formal study of how rational actors interact to pursue incentives. It investigates situations of conflict and cooperation.

Game theory is an extremely powerful and robust tool in analyzing much more complex situations, such as: mergers and acquisitions, political economy, voting systems, war bargaining and biological evolution. Eight game-theorists have won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.
