# Utilitronium

**Utilitronium** is relatively homogeneous matter optimized for maximum [[Utility Functions|utility]] (like [computronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium) is optimized for maximum computing power). For a [[Paperclip Maximizer|paperclip maximizer]], utilitronium is paperclips. For more [[Complexity of Value|complex values]], no homogeneous organization of matter will have optimal utility.

Utilitronium shockwave is a process of converting all matter in the universe into utilitronium as quickly as possible, which would look like a shockwave of utilitronium spreading outwards from the point of origin, presumably nearly at the speed of light.
