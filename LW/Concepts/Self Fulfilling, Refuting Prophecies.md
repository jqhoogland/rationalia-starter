A **Self Fulfilling Prophecy** is a prophecy that, when made, affects the environment such that it becomes more likely. similarly, a **Self Refuting Prophecy**Â is a prophecy that when made makes itself less likely. This is also relevant for beliefs that can affect reality directly without being voiced, for example, the belief "I'm confident" can increase a person confidence, thus making it true, while the opposite belief can reduce a person's confidence, thus also making it true.
