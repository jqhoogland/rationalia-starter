# Puzzle Game Index

This page was inspired by [Better thinking through experiential games](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1cu/better_thinking_through_experiential_games/), and some of the comments on this post.

This page is an attempt to create a list of online games that can be used to test your rationality, your problem-solving skills, etc. Unfortunately very few of these games directly test Bayesian reasoning, and the puzzles tend to be unrealistic, which means that they test how good you are at puzzle games, rather than how good you are at real-world rationality. Still, creating this list seemed like it would be worth a try.

Most of the game links are from Kongregate.com. If you sign up for a kongregate.com account, the site will keep track of your achievements in the games. You can then link to [your badges page](http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/PeerInfinity/badges) to show off which badges you've collected.
