# Doubt

The proper purpose of a doubt is to destroy its target belief [[Litany of Tarski|if and only if]] it is false. Merely going around doubting things, without following up and investigating, doesn't help you get truer beliefs. The mere feeling of crushing uncertainty is not virtuous unto an aspiring rationalist; probability theory is the law that says we must be uncertain to the exact extent to which the evidence merits uncertainty.
