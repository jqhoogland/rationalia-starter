# Journaling

**Journaling** is the practice of recording events in your life, usually by writing about it daily.

Journaling can help to remember things in your past - such as special events, belief updates, mood and emotional states - and track how they change across time. It can also help you notice and reflect on things, either naturally by thinking back on things that happened, or more directly helping you focus on things through prompting, like [[Gratitude|gratitude]] journaling which can help you focus on things you're grateful for.

There are various forms of jounraling:

- Daily / Non-daily / Irregularly: Most people jounral daily, but journaling can also be done on a different cycle, or irregularly.
- Prompts / Free-form / Mixed: Prompts can help you focus on specific things you want to journal about, but may also feel cumbersome for some people or at some times.
- Digital / Handwritten / Audio: Classically, of course, journaling was solely handwritten. Today it's also possible to write in a digital format. And it's also possible to keep an audio journal by recording yourself instead of writing.
