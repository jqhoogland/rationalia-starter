# Not Technically A Lie

A statement that is literally true, but causes the listener to attain false beliefs by performing incorrect inference, is **not technically a lie**. Since the purpose of communication is to transfer beliefs to the other person's mind, there is little practical distinction between lying and not technically lying. Depending on circumstances, one may be preferable to another, but only by a slim margin. A weapon of [[Dark Arts|dark arts]], or an [attire](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/belief_as_attire) for someone identifying with truth-telling.
