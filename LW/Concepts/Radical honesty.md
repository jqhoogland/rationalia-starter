**Radical honesty** is a communication technique proposed by [Brad Blanton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Blanton) in which discussion partners are not permitted to lie or deceive at all. Rather than being designed to enhance [[Group Rationality|group]] [epistemic rationality](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/epistemic_rationality), radical honesty is designed to reduce stress and remove the layers of deceit that burden much of discourse.

The Radical Honesty technique includes having practitioners state their feelings bluntly and directly, even if it may be in a way typically considered impolite. Avoiding all "white lying" is said to lead to a more truthful relationship with themselves and others.
