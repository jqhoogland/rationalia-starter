# Logical Induction

Logical Induction is a formal theory of reasoning under [[Logical Uncertainty|logical uncertainty]], developed by Scott Garrabrant and other researchers. Rationality is defined through a prediction-market analogy. High-quality beliefs are those which are computationally difficult to win bets against. The writeup can be found [here](https://intelligence.org/2016/09/12/new-paper-logical-induction/).

An attempt at saving induction (in a theories of the present should hold into the future sense):

- Time-invariance = Energy conservation Noether's theorem
- Breaking time-invariance = Breaking energy conservation
- Breaking energy conservation = end of universe as we know it
