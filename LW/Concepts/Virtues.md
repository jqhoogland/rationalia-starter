**Virtues** are traits that one *ought* to possess, for the benefit of the world or oneself.

On LessWrong the focus is often on epistemic virtues, as in Eliezer Yudowsky's essay [[Twelve Virtues of Rationality|**Twelve Virtues of Rationality**]] which offers this list of virtues (roughly summarized):

*   [**Curiosity**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/curiosity) \- the burning desire to pursue truth;
*   **Relinquishment** \- not being attached to mistaken beliefs;
*   **Lightness** \- updating your beliefs with ease;
*   [[Evenness|**Evenness**]] \- not privileging particular hypotheses in the pursuit of truth;
*   **Argument** \- the will to let one's beliefs be challenged;
*   [**Empiricism**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/empiricism) \- grounding oneself in observation and prediction;
*   [[Occam's Razor|**Simplicity**]] \- elimination of unnecessary detail in modeling the world;
*   [**Humility**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/humility) \- recognition of one's fallibility;
*   [[Perfectionism|**Perfectionism**]] \- seeking perfection even if it's not attainable;
*   **Precision** \- seeking narrower statements and not overcorrect;
*   [**Scholarship**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/scholarship-and-learning) \- the study of multiple domains and perspectives;
*   [**The nameless virtue**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/twelfth-virtue) \- seeking truth and not the virtues for themselves.
