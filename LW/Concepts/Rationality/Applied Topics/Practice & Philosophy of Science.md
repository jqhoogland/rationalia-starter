# Practice & Philosophy of Science

**Practice and Philosophy of Science** is for posts that discuss how science is done or should be done; examples include [Building Intuitions on Non-Empirical Arguments in Science](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tSemJckYr29Gnxod2/building-intuitions-on-non-empirical-arguments-in-science) and the [Science and Rationality sequence](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/fxynfGCSHpY4FmBZy). (It is not for posts that simply report on a new scientific result.)
