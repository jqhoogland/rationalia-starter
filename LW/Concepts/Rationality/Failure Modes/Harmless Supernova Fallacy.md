A class of arguments (subclass of [[False Dilemma]] or [[Fallacy of Gray|Continuum fallacy]]) that can be used to argue that any real phenomenon (the typical example is a supernova) is harmless.

- **Bounded, therefore harmless**
- **Continuous, therefore harmless**
- **Varying, therefore harmless**
- **Mundane, therefore harmless** aka **straw superpower**
- **Precedented, therefore harmless**
- **Undefinable, therefore harmless**

The **harmless supernova fallacy** may involve any of the following explanations for why some event is harmless:

{{c1::**Bounded**: supernova isn't infinitely energetic}}
{{c2::**Continuous**: temperature is continuous, so what is "hot"?}}
{{c3::**Varying**: a supernova wouldn't heat up all areas the same}}
{{c4::**Mundane** or **straw superpower**: a supernova can't burn through time itself}}
{{c5::**Precedented**: supernovas have been around for a while}}
{{c5::**Undefinable**: what is "heat" really?}}
