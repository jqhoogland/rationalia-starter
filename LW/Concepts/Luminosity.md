Luminosity is reflective awareness. A luminous mental state is one that you have and know that you have. It could be an [emotion](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/emotions), a [belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief) or [alief](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/alief), a disposition, a quale, a memory - anything that might happen or be stored in your brain. What's going on in your head?
