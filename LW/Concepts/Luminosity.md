# Luminosity

**Luminosity** was Alicorn's term for reflective awareness. More recent posts tend to use the term [[Introspection|introspection]]. See also [[Noticing|noticing]].

A luminous mental state is one that you have and know that you have. It could be an [[Emotions|emotion]], a [[Belief|belief]] or [[Alief|alief]], a disposition, a quale, a memory - anything that might happen or be stored in your brain. What's going on in your head?
