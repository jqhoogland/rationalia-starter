# Censorship

**Censorship** is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or "inconvenient." Censorship can be conducted by governments, private institutions, and other controlling bodies. [(From Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship)
