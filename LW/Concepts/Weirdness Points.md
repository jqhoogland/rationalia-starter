**Weirdness Points** posit that the ability to convince people to believe, do, or respect something that sounds weird is a limited resource.

Someone with dozens of unconventional beliefs and habits will seem too eccentric to be worth paying attention to, but someone who pushes one weird thing while otherwise being respectable has a shot at convincing the people around them to take it seriously too.
