# Cause Prioritization

**Cause Prioritization** is the process of researching which charitable causes offer the most benefit for the marginal investment. Priorities can shift as existing causes reach funding and hiring goals, and new opportunities to do good are discovered. Cause prioritization is an important part of [[Effective Altruism]].
