# Probabilistic Reasoning

Probabilistic reasoning is the opposite of black and white thinking. 

**When you reason in black and white** you ask questions like: Is this true? Is this the right thing to do? Am I sick? 

**When you reason probabilistically** you ask questions like: How likely is this? What's the [expected value](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/expected-value) of this action? What [[Scientific Evidence, Legal Evidence, Rational Evidence|evidence]] have I seen that I am sick, and what evidence that I'm not? How likely is it that I'm sick *[[Priors|without]]* taking any evidence into account?

Reasoning probabilistically allows you to change your mind [incrementally](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/627DZcvme7nLDrbZu/update-yourself-incrementally), accumulating many small pieces of evidence rather than requiring one overwhelmingly convincing piece.

On LessWrong, 'probabilistic reasoning' usually refers to [[Bayes' Theorem|Bayes theorem]], which formally defines the optimal way to change your beliefs when you see evidence.
