# Automation

**Automation** is "the use of largely automatic equipment in a system of manufacturing or other production process". \[1\] This includes, but is not limited to, most of the processes involved in car manufacturing, and many ways that computer programs are applied.

\[1\]: New Oxford American Dictionary
