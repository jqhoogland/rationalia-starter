# Rationality Is Systematized Winning

The point of all this discussion of rationality is to actually achieve truer beliefs and more effective actions. It's not some arbitrary social fashion; there are actual criteria of success. It is for this reason that it is written that **rationalists should** ***win***. If some particular [[Rituals of Cognition|ritual of cognition]]—even one that you have long cherished as "rational"—systematically gives poorer results relative to some alternative, it is *not* rational to cling to it. The rational algorithm is to *do what works*, to get the actual *answer*—in short, to *win*, whatever the method, whatever the means. If you can *detect* a systematic mistake in your thinking, then *fix it*; if you can *see* a better method, then *adopt it*.
