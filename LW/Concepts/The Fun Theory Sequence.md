# The Fun Theory Sequence

A concrete theory of transhuman values. How much fun is there in the universe; will we ever run out of fun; are we having fun yet; could we be having more fun. Part of the [[Complexity of Value|complexity of value]] thesis. Also forms part of the fully general answer to religious [theodicy](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/theodicy).

A guide to this sequence is available at [The Fun Theory Sequence (post)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/).
