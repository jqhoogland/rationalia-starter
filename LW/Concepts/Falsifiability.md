**Falsifiability** or **Refutability** is the capacity for a statement, theory or hypothesis to be contradicted by evidence. For example, the statement "All swans are white" is falsifiable because one can observe that black swans exist. [(From Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)
