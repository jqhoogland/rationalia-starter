# Bounties (closed)

A **bounty** or is a monetary payment for accomplishing some one-off task. (If the winner is selected in a competition, it is often referred to as a **prize**.) On LessWrong, bounties have historically been paid out for things like providing useful information, doing a novel piece of research, or changing someone's mind about a topic. 

This tag is for bounties that have already been paid out. It has a sister tag for active bounties.  

*If you're hosting a bounty, please make sure to change the tags to indicate the status of the bounty. *
