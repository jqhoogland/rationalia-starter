# Futility of Chaos

A complex of related ideas having to do with the **impossibility of generating useful work from entropy** â€” a position which holds **against** the ideas that e.g:

- Our artistic creativity stems from the noisiness of human neurons;
- Randomized algorithms can exhibit performance inherently superior to deterministic algorithms;
- The human brain is a chaotic system and this explains its power; non-chaotic systems cannot exhibit intelligence.
