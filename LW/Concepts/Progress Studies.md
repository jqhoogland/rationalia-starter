# Progress Studies

**Progress Studies** is the study of the causes of civilizational progress, e.g., the combination of economic, technological, scientific, and cultural advancements that have transformed human life and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries.

## Origin of the Name

*Progress Studies* was proposed as an academic field by Tyler Cowen and Patrick Collison \[[1](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/)\] after they noticed that there’s no intellectual movement focused on understanding the dynamics of progress, or on trying to speed it up.
