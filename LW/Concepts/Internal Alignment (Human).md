# Internal Alignment (Human)

**Internal Alignment** is a broadly desirable state. By default, humans sometimes have internal conflict. You might frame that as conflict between subagents, or subprocesses within the human. You might instead frame it as a single agent making complicated decisions. The "internal alignment" hypothesis is that you can become much more productive/happier/fulfilled by getting yourself into alignment with yourself.
