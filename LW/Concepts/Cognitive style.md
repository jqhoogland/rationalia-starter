Certain cognitive styles might tend to produce more accurate results. A common distinction between cognitive styles is that of foxes vs. hedgehogs, based on [Isiah Berlin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isiah_Berlin) famous essay.

Foxes and Hedgehogs
-------------------

This common distinction comes primarily from the essay "The Hedgehog and the Fox" by [Isiah Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isiah_Berlin), regarding the Russian author [Leo Tolstoy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy) theory of history.

The title is a reference to a fragment attributed to the ancient Greek poet [Archilochus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archilochus): ("The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing").

Berlin expands upon this idea to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea and foxes who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea.

This distinction is used by [Philip Tetlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Tetlock) in the book *Expert Political Judgement*, which concludes that foxes tend to be better [[Calibration|calibrated]] and more accurate[^1^](#fn1).
