# Illusion of Transparency

The **illusion of transparency** is the misleading impression that your words convey more to others than they really do. Words are a means of communication, but they don't in themselves *contain* meaning. The word *apple* is just five letters, two syllables. I use it to *refer* to a concept and its associations in my mind, under the reasonable assumption that it refers to a similar concept and group of associations in *your* mind; this is the only power words have, great though it may be. Unfortunately, it's easy to lose track of this fact, think as if your words have meanings inherently encoded in them, leading to a tendency to systematically overestimate the effectiveness of communication.
