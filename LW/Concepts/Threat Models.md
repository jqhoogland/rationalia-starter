A threat model is a story of how a particular risk (e.g. AI) plays out.

In the AI case, [according to Rohin Shah](https://ssconlinemeetup.substack.com/p/video-from-rohins-talk), a threat model is ideally: 
> Combination of a development model that says how we get AGI and a risk model that says how AGI leads to existential catastrophe.
