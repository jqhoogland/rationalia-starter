# Whole Brain Emulation
Whole Brain Emulation or WBE is a proposed technique which involves transferring the information contained within a brain onto a computing substrate. The brain can then be simulated, creating a machine intelligence. The concept is often discussed in context of scanning the brain of a person, known as [[Mind Uploading]].

WBE is sometimes seen as an easy way to creating intelligent computers, as the only innovations necessary are greatly increased processor speed and scanning resolution. Advocates of WBE claim technological improvement rates such as [Moore's law](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Moore's_law) will make WBE inevitable.

The exact level of detail required for an accurate simulation of a brain's mind is presently uncertain, and will determine the difficulty of creating WBE. The feasibility of such a project has been examined in detail in [[Future of Humanity Institute (FHI)|Future of Humanity Institute]]'s [[Brain Emulation Roadmap|Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap]]. The Roadmap concluded that a human brain emulation would be possible before mid-century, providing that current technology trends kept up and providing that there would be sufficient investments....[(Read More)]()
