# Signaling

Signaling is [defined](https://lessestwrong.com/lw/did/what_is_signaling_really/) by [Yvain](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Yvain) as "a method of conveying information among not-necessarily-trustworthy parties by performing an action which is more likely or less costly if the information is true than if it is not true". Some signaling is performed exclusively to impress others (to improve your [[Social Status|status]]), and in some cases [isn't even worth that](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/excess_signalin.html). In other cases, signaling is a side-effect of an otherwise useful activity.

For example, if doing something is easy for one type of person and hard for another type of person, you might do that thing just to get people to think you're the former type of person, even if the thing isn't in itself worth doing. This could explain many facets of human behavior, and reveal opportunities for reducing waste.

Not all signaling is about abilities. Signaling can also be about personality, current emotional state, beliefs, loyalty to a particular group, status within a group, etcâ€¦.[(Read More)]()

## [[Belief#Attire Signaling group identity]]

## Science as Attire

- Consider the number of people who profess a belief in [[Evolution]] without any knowledge of its workings. Who spew the craziest bullshit with the straightest faces.
- The number who only recognize science as literary genre. ([Source](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5uZQHpecjn7955faL/p/4Bwr6s9dofvqPWakn))
- "Because science" [[Semantic stop-sign]] -> we defer to another's authority and kill our chance at [[Curiosity]]

## Failure and Spirituality

Some people take sadistic pleasure in parading their own flaws. In asceticism and sobriety.
