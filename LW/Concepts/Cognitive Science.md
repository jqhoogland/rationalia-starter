**Cognitive science** draws upon a variety of different disciplines to try to describe and explain the way humans think. It heavily involves [neuroscience](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/neuroscience?showPostCount=true&useTagName=true), [psychology](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/psychology), and philosophy. It differs from neuroscience in that it focuses less on relating structure to function, and more on using many approaches to form higher-level models to predict behaviour.
