# Cognitive Science

**Cognitive science** draws upon a variety of different disciplines to try to describe and explain the way humans think. It heavily involves [[Neuroscience|neuroscience]], [[Psychology|psychology]], and philosophy. It differs from neuroscience in that it focuses less on relating structure to function, and more on using many approaches to form higher-level models to predict behaviour.
