**Correspondence bias** (also known as the **fundamental attribution error**) is the tendency to overestimate the the contribution of lasting traits and dispositions in determining people's behavior, as compared to situational effects. We might see someone kicking a vending machine, and conclude they're an inherently angry person. But maybe they just failed a test, had their driving license revoked, and had the machine eat their money for the third time this week. We think of the other person as an [[Human Universal|evil mutant]] and ourselves as righteous actors.
