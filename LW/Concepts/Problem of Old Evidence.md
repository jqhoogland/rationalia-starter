Suppose a new scientific hypothesis, such as general relativity, explains a well-know observation such as the [perihelion precession of mercury](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity) better than any existing theory. Intuitively, this is a point in favor of the new theory. However, the probability for the well-known observation was already at 100%. How can a previously-known statement provide new support for the hypothesis, as if we are re-updating on evidence we've already updated on long ago? This is known as [**the problem of old evidence**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/#ObjSimPriConRulInfOthObjBayConThe), and is usually levelled as a charge against Bayesian epistemology.
