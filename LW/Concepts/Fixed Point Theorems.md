**Fixed Point Theorems** are very general theorems in mathematics that show for a given function \\(f\\) and input \\(x\\) that \\(f(x) = x\\). We say that the input \\(x\\) is a fixed point for the function \\(f\\).

These come up most commonly on LessWrong in work around [[Embedded Agency|Embedded Agency]] research, as well as in discussion of game theory.
