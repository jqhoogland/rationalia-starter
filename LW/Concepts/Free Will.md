# Free Will

**Free will** is one of the *easiest* hard questions, as millennia-old philosophical dilemmas go. Though this [impossible question](http://lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/) is generally considered [fully and completely dissolved](http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/) on Less Wrong, aspiring reductionists should **try to solve it on their own**.

## Non-spoiler posts

The following posts can be read to set up the problem of "free will" and what constitutes a good solution from a reductionist perspective, without entirely giving away the solution. (When Yudkowsky wrote these posts, he thought he could get away with just leaving it as a practice problem, and some of the posts state that the problem will be left open. However Yudkowsky did eventually find that he needed to write out the whole solution.)

- [**Dissolving the Question**](http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/) \- this is where the "free will" puzzle is explicitly posed, along with criteria for what does and does not constitute a satisfying answer.
