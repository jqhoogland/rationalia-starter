Becoming more [epistemically rational](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality#Epistemic_rationality) can only guarantee one thing: what you believe will include more of the [truth](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/truth-semantics-and-meaning). Knowing that truth might [help you achieve your goals](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/instrumental_rationality), or cause you to become a pariah. Be sure that you really want to know the truth before you commit to finding it; otherwise, you may flinch from it.
