# Stupidity of Evolution

**[[Evolution|Evolution]]** **is stupid,** it can only access a very limited area in the design space, and can only search for the new designs very slowly, for a variety of reasons. The wonder of evolution is not how intelligently it works, but that an accidentally occurring optimizer without a brain works *at all*.
