# Smoking Lesion

**The Smoking Lesion** is a problem for testing [[Decision Theory|decision theories]], stated as follows:

> Smoking is strongly correlated with lung cancer, but in the world of the Smoker's Lesion this correlation is understood to be the result of a common cause: a genetic lesion that tends to cause both smoking and cancer. Once we fix the presence or absence of the lesion, there is no additional correlation between smoking and cancer.
> 
> Suppose you prefer smoking without cancer to not smoking without cancer, and prefer smoking with cancer to not smoking with cancer. Should you smoke?

Naive [causal decision theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_decision_theory) says "yes", since smoking in this world has no causal effect on whether or not you get cancer. You either get cancer or not; in both cases, smoking is preferred. Naive [evidential decision theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidential_decision_theory) says "no", because smoking is strongly *correlated* with cancer. [[Functional Decision Theory]] says "yes": your decision procedure in this problem doesn't influence whether or not you get cancer - and with or without cancer, smoking is preferred.
