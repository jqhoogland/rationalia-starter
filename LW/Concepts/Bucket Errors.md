# Bucket Errors

A **Bucket Error** is when multiple different concepts or variables are incorrectly lumped together in one's mind as a single concept/variable, potentially leading to distortions of one's thinking. Bucket Errors are related to [Fallacies of Compression](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5MxoeacRKKM3KQth/fallacies-of-compression).



The term*,* *Bucket Error*, was introduced in ["Flinching away from truth” is often about \*protecting\* the epistemology](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EEv9JeuY5xfuDDSgF/flinching-away-from-truth-is-often-about-protecting-the) where an example is given of a child who refuses to believe that they made a spelling mistake. The child is unwilling to believe this fact because they believe having made a spelling mistake is incompatible with becoming a writer which is their dream. "Becoming a writer" and "never making spelling mistakes" are lumped in the same bucket despite in fact being separate variables.

Bucket Errors are similar to the concepts of [equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation), identification in Buddhism, or fusion/defusion in modern psychotherapy. See: [Fusion and Equivocation in Korzybski's General Semantics](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RQrWd5jPZQtpH8f4v/fusion-and-equivocation-in-korzybski-s-general-semantics).
