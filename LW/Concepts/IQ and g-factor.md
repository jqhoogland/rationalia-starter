# IQ and G-factor

**IQ** is a score derived from a set of standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence. The **g-factor** (general intelligence factor) is the underlying psychometric construct that the IQ tests are trying to measure.

This tag is specifically for discussions about these formal constructs. For discussions about artificial intelligence, see [[AI]]. For discussions about human-level intelligence in a broader sense, see [[General Intelligence]].
