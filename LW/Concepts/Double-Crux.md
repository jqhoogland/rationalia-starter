# Double-Crux

**Double-Crux** is a technique for addressing complex disagreements by systematically uncovering the *cruxes* upon which the disagreement hinges. A crux for an individual is any fact that if they believed differently about it, they would change their conclusion in the overall disagreement. A *double-crux* is a crux for both parties. Perhaps we disagree on whether swimming in a lake is safe. A crux for each of us is the presence of crocodiles in water: I believe there aren't, you believe there are. Either of us would change our mind about the safety if we were persuaded about this crux.

Double-Crux differs from typical debates which are usually adversarial (your opinion vs mine), and instead attempt to be a collaborative attempt to uncover the true structure of the disagreement and what would change the disputants minds.

A version of the technique is described in [Double Crux – A Strategy for Resolving Disagreement](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement) written by (then) CFAR instructor, Duncan_Sabien. The Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR) originated the technique. Eli Tyre, another CFAR instructor who has spent a lot of time developing the technique, more recently shared [The Basic Double Crux pattern](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hNztRARB52Riy36Kz/the-basic-double-crux-pattern).
