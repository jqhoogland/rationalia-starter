# Exploratory Engineering

**Exploratory engineering** is a process for understanding a subset of the potential capabilities of future levels of technology. This process resembles the first phase of standard design engineering (termed conceptual engineering, or conceptual design), but it serves a different purpose:

- In standard engineering, design leads to the manufacturing of a product.
- In exploratory engineering, design leads to understanding of what a future manufacturing process could produce.

Exploratory engineering allows to show how some capabilities that intuitively seem [[Absurdity Heuristic|absurd]] may actually be achieved in the future.
