# Stagnation

Quoting Jason Crawford's *Technological Stagnation: Why I came around:*

> Thiel, along with economists such as Tyler Cowen ([*The Great Stagnation*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H0M8QS?tag=jasocraw-20)) and Robert Gordon ([*The Rise and Fall of American Growth*](https://rootsofprogress.org/summary-the-rise-and-fall-of-american-growth)), promotes a “stagnation hypothesis”: that there has been a significant slowdown in scientific, technological, and economic progress in recent decades—say, for a round number, since about 1970, or the last ~50 years.

Eliezer has posted [a short work of fiction on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3xgqj6/wp_write_a_dystopian_vision_of_the_future_from/cy4zyfd/) which explores related ideas.
