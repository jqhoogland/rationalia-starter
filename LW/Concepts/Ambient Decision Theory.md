# Ambient Decision Theory

A variant of [[Updateless Decision Theory|updateless decision theory]] that uses first order logic instead of mathematical intuition module (MIM), emphasizing the way an agent can [control which mathematical structure a fixed definition defines](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2os/controlling_constant_programs/), an aspect of UDT separate from its own emphasis on not making the mistake of updating away things one can still acausally control.
