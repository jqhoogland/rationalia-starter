# Reversed Stupidity Is Not Intelligence

It takes a lot of evidence and rationality just to [[Locate The Hypothesis|*locate* a good hypothesis]] in the search space. Getting it right is a precise Art, whereas there are a million ways to get it wrong. A stopped clock is right twice a day; answering true-or-false questions at entirely at random will still yield a fifty percent success rate. To [[Tsuyoku Naritai|do better]], you can't just perform a reversal of an obvious fallacy. **Reversed stupidity is not intelligence**; faulty reasoning does not produce "antitrue" conclusions that can just be negated; the true theory should make sense on its own terms; not just as a refutation of some nonsense.
