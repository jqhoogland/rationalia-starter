# Feedback & Criticism (topic)

**Feedback** is information about people's reactions to an event, object, person, place, or idea. Many writers, developers, entrepreneurs, and other content creators try to get feedback so they can know how to improve their creations. **Positive feedback** is positive information in a reaction - i.e. being told that one's hair looks nice, while **negative feedback** or **criticism** is the opposite - i.e. being told that one's hair looks like a mop.
