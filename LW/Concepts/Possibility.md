# Possibility

Words in natural language carry [[Connotation|connotations]] that may become misleading when the words get applied with technical precision. While it's [[Not Technically A Lie|not technically a lie]] to say that it's **possible** to win a lottery, the statement is deceptive. It's much more precise, for communication of the actual fact through connotation, to say that it's *impossible* to win the [[Lottery|lottery]]. This is an example of [[Antiprediction|anti-prediction]].
