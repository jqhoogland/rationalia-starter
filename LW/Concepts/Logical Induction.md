# Logical Induction

**Logical Induction** is a formal theory of reasoning under [[Logical Uncertainty|logical uncertainty]], developed by Scott Garrabrant and other researchers. Rationality is defined through a prediction-market analogy. High-quality beliefs are those which are computationally difficult to win bets against. The writeup can be found [here](https://intelligence.org/2016/09/12/new-paper-logical-induction/).
