# Aumann's Agreement Theorem

**Aumann's agreement theorem**, roughly speaking, says that two agents acting rationally (in a certain precise sense) and with [[Common Knowledge|common knowledge]] of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree. More specifically, if two people are genuine [[Bayesianism|Bayesians]], share common [[Priors|priors]], and have common knowledge of each other's current probability assignments, then they must have equal probability assignments.
