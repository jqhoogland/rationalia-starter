# Trolley Problem

The [**trolley problem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) is a decision scenario which illustrates/tests ethical reasoning. ("Trolley problems" are modified scenarios inspired by the basic one.) In the classic scenario, you are faced with a situation where five people will die if you do nothing. However, you can kill a bystander to save the lives of the five. Many people will choose to do nothing, even though many utilitarian/consequentialist positions would say to kill the bystander.
