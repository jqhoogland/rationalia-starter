# Magic

Traditional depictions of **magic** would seem to require introducing _complex_ ontologically fundamental entities: some magician or sorceress says the right words and performs some ritual, and some part of the universe obeys their will. But how does it _know_ when to obey someone's will? The stated conditions for the effect are [[Magical Categories|far too complex]] to be implemented by a simple arrangement of mechanistic laws, the complexity of magic must be at least that of minds. What seems to humans like a simple explanation, sometimes [[Occam's Razor|isn't at all]].

In our own naturalistic, [[Reductionism|reductionist]] universe, there is always a simpler explanation. Any complicated thing that happens, happens because there is some physical mechanism behind it, even if you don't _know_ the mechanism yourself (which is most of the time). There is no magic.
