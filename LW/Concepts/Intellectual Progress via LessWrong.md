One of the core goals of the [**LessWrong 2.0 platform**](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) is to generate [**intellectual progress**](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/intellectual-progress), specifically [[Differential Intellectual Progress|differential intellectual progress]] on important questions. There is much to discuss: should LessWrong 2.0 be a vehicle for intellectual progress? Is it succeeding? What should it do to succeed more?
