# Calibration

Someone is **well-calibrated** if the things they predict with X% chance of happening in fact occur X% of the time. Importantly, calibration is *not the same as accuracy.* Calibration is about accurately assessing how good your predictions are, not making good predictions. Person A, whose predictions are marginally better than chance (60% of them come true when choosing from two options) and who is precisely 60% confident in their choices, is perfectly calibrated. In contrast, Person B, who is 99% confident in their predictions, and right 90% of the time, is more *accurate* than Person A, but less *well-calibrated*.

Being well-calibrated has value for rationalists separately from accuracy. Among other things, being well-calibrated lets you make good [[Betting|bets]] / [[Planning & Decision-Making|make good decisions]], communicate information helpfully to others if they know you to be well-calibrated (See [[Group Rationality]]), and helps prioritize [[Value of Information|which information is worth acquiring]].

Note that all expressions of quantified confidence in [[Anticipated Experiences|beliefs]] can be wellor poorlycalibrated. For example, calibration applies to whether a person's 95% confidence intervals captures the true outcome 95% of the time.
