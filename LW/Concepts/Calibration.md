Someone is **well-calibrated** if the things they predict with X% chance of happening in fact occur X% of the time. Importantly, calibration is _not the same as accuracy._ Calibration is about accurately assessing how good your predictions are, not making good predictions. Person A, whose predictions are marginally better than chance (60% of them come true when choosing from two options) and who is precisely 60% confident in their choices, is perfectly calibrated. In contrast, Person B, who is 99% confident in their predictions, and right 90% of the time, is more _accurate_ than Person A, but less _well-calibrated_.

Being well-calibrated has value for rationalists separately from accuracy. Among other things, being well-calibrated lets you make good [bets](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/betting) / [[Planning & Decision-Making|make good decisions]], communicate information helpfully to others if they know you to be well-calibrated (See [Group Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/group-rationality)), and helps prioritize [[Value of Information|which information is worth acquiring]].

Note that all expressions of quantified confidence in [beliefs](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anticipated-experiences?showPostCount=false&useTagName=false) can be well- or poorly- calibrated. For example, calibration applies to whether a person's 95% confidence intervals captures the true outcome 95% of the time.
