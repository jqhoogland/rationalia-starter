# Intellectual Progress (Individual-Level)

This tag is closely related to [[Scholarship & Learning]]. However, Scholarship & Learning covers learning existing material, almost to the exclusion of developing new ideas. The present tag is exclusively about developing new ideas (or at least new-to-you ideas which *could have been* new to the world, if someone else hadn't invented them yet).

As you can see from the names, [[Intellectual Progress (Society-Level)|Intellectual Progress (Society Level)]] is a related tag which deals with how progress happens for whole societies. The present tag deals with the same theme on an individual level.

Posts on making progress in small groups are also welcome to this tag. The relevant cutoff is not the number of people (one vs many), but rather, the *relevance to an individual who is trying to make intellectual progress.* If a post is on the nuts-and-bolts process of making intellectual progress happen, it belongs here.
