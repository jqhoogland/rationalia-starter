**Dual Process Theory** posits two types of processes in the human brain. According to one characterization, **Type 2** (also known as **System 2**) processes are those which require working memory, and **Type 1** (also known as **System 1**) are those which not.

> The terms System 1 and System 2 were originally coined by the psychologist Keith Stanovich and then popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book _Thinking, Fast and Slow._ Stanovich noted that a number of fields within psychology had been developing various kinds of theories distinguishing between fast/intuitive on the one hand and slow/deliberative thinking on the other. Often these fields were not aware of each other. The S1/S2 model was offered as a general version of these specific theories, highlighting features of the two modes of thought that tended to appear in all the theories.

> Since then, academics have continued to discuss the models. Among other developments, _Stanovich and other authors have discontinued the use of the System 1/System 2 terminology as misleading_, choosing to instead talk about Type 1 and Type 2 processing. \[...\] there’s no single “System 1”: rather, a wide variety of different processes and systems are lumped together under this term. It is also unclear whether there is any single System 2, either. \[...\]

> People sometimes refer to Type 1 reasoning as biased, and to Type 2 reasoning as unbiased. But \[...\] there is nothing that makes one of the two types intrinsically more or less biased than the other. The bias-correction power of Type 2 processing emerges from the fact that _if_ Type 1 operations are known to be erroneous _and_ a rule-based procedure for correcting them exists, a Type 2 operation can be learned which implements that rule.
