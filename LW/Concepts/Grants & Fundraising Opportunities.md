# Grants & Fundraising Opportunities

Many LessWrong readers actively rely on **grants or fundraising opportunities** to support their work (for example by running non-profits or startups, working as independent researchers, or being supported by academic grants). 

This tag lists concrete opportunities for fundraising of interest to the LessWrong community. This typically means projects working on improving the long-term future, refining the art of rationality, and related missions.  

This tag should not be used for meta-discussion, e.g. of fundraising strategies, coordination between funders, or cost-benefit analyses of particular funding opportunities.
