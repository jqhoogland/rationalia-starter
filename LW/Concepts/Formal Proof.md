# Formal Proof

A **Formal Proof** is a finite sequence of steps from [axiom(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) or previous derived proof(s) which strictly follow the allowed rules of [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) of the [[Logic & Mathematics |mathematical system]] in which it exists. They are used to establish statements as true within a mathematical framework in a way which can be independently verified with extremely high certainty, with the most reliable flavor of proof being machine-checked proofs generated by [proof assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) since they have even less room for human error.
