# Error of Crowds

The **error of crowds** is the idea that under some scoring rules, the average error becomes less than the error of the average, thus making the average belief tautologically worse than a belief of a random person. Compare this to the ideas of [[Modesty Argument|modesty argument]] and [wisdom of the crowd](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/wisdom-of-the-crowd).

A related idea is that a popular belief is likely to be wrong because the less popular ones couldn't maintain support if they were worse than the popular one.
