This tag collects specific meetups that an organizer can run or things community members can do when they come together. It does include instructions or at least an inspiring outline for running a particular activity, exercise, discussion or game with a group. It can also include guidance for events such as Winter Solstice or Petrov Day that a community might come together for. It does not include general advice for running meetups or discussions on the purpose of meetups. It also does not include announcements of meetups that will be held at a particular time and place, which would be under [[Events (Community)|Events]]. The intended purpose of this tag is to be something a meetup organizer can browse, thinking "what should I run for my group next meeting?"
