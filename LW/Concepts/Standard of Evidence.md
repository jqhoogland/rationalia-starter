A standard of evidence or standard of admissible evidence seeks to narrow down the type of [rational evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rational-evidence) which may be brought to bear on any kind of (partially or wholly) [adversarial process](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/adversarial_process), such as scientific research, law or politics. A common standard of evidence is thought to be needed in any such process, so as to avoid a breakdown of useful [deliberation](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/deliberation). This is the basic contribution of the [scientific method](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/science) and of legal evidence standards.
