# Standard of Evidence

A **standard of evidence** or **standard of admissible evidence** seeks to narrow down the type of [[Rational Evidence|rational evidence]] which may be brought to bear on any kind of (partially or wholly) [adversarial process](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/adversarial_process), such as scientific research, law or politics. A common standard of evidence is thought to be needed in any such process, so as to avoid a breakdown of useful [deliberation](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/deliberation). This is the basic contribution of the [[Science|scientific method]] and of legal evidence standards.
