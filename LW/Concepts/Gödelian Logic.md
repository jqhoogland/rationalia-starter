**Gödelian Logic** refers to logic, math, and arguments in the style of [Kurt Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del). Specifically - his two incompleteness theorems, and one completeness theorem. Due to their tricky and subtle nature, his incompleteness theorems are possibly the most misunderstood theorems of all time.

> “All the limitative theorems of metamathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally. [Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_incompleteness_theorems), Church’s Undecidability Theorem, [Turing’s Halting Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), [Tarski’s Truth Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem) — all have the flavour of some ancient fairy tale which warns you that “To seek self-knowledge is to embark on a journey which … will always be incomplete, cannot be charted on any map, will never halt, cannot be described.” *\- Douglas Hofstadter, Gödel, Escher, Bach*

### Gödel's Completeness Theorem

This theorem is less well known than the other two, which came after it, but also less misunderstood. 

### Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem

### Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem

### Probabilistic Solutions

One way you might think to get around Gödel's Incompleteness, is to leave behind logical certainty, and instead [assign probabilities to logical statements](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/duAkuSqJhGDcfMaTA/reflection-in-probabilistic-logic).
