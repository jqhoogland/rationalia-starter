# Teleology

**Teleology** is the study of things that happen for the sake of their future consequences.

Since nothing is ever *actually* the causal result of a future event, 'teleology' names a fallacy, that is, the fallacy of reasoning as if an event could be the result of a future event, its consequence.

A non-fallacious interpretation of teleology is as the study of things that happen because of their *intended* results, where the intention existed in an actual mind in the prior past, and so was causally able to bring about the event by planning and acting.
