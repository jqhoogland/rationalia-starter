# Adding Up to Normality

"It all adds up to normality" is a common phrase used on LessWrong (also known here as Egan's law\[1\]). **Adding Up to Normality** is the property of an explanation which adds to our understanding without changing what we already know to be true. for example:

*   Apples didn't stop falling when General Relativity supplanted Newtonian mechanics.
*   As counterintuitive as quantum mechanics is, it all adds up to what we see in everyday life - [[Reality Is Normal|It's perfectly normal]], and it always has been.

The purpose of a theory is to add up to observed reality. Science sets out to answer the question "*What* adds up to normality?" and the answer turns out to be "*Quantum mechanics* adds up to normality" or "General Relativity adds up to normality".

A weaker extension of this principle applies to ethical and metaethical debates, which generally ought to end up explaining why you *shouldn't* eat babies, rather than why you *should*.
