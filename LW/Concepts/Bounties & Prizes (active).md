# Bounties & Prizes (active)

A **bounty** is a monetary payment for accomplishing some task. On LessWrong, bounties have historically been paid out for things like providing useful information, doing a novel piece of research, or changing someone's mind about a topic. 

This tag is for bounties that are actively accepting submissions. (It has a sister for bounties that have closed.)

Bounties might be listed in the post itself or in its comments. 

*If you're hosting a bounty, please make sure to change the tags to indicate the status of the bounty. *
