# Principles

*“**Principles** are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.”* ― Ray Dalio, Principles: Life and Work.  
  
Principles, Heuristics, and rules of thumb are generalizations that aim to produce an optimal outcome relative to their cheapness as decision rules.   
  
Not using generalizations, Rules of thumb and Heuristics isn't possible. precise decision rules such as [[Bayes' Theorem|Bayes Theorem]] are [computationally intractable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion) even to computers, and surely aren't feasible for humans. the question become whether you have good and effective principles to guide you.
