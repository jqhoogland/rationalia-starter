The **conjunction fallacy** consists in assuming that specific conditions are more probable than more general ones.

For the reasons related to [[Representativeness Heuristic|representativeness heuristic]], a fleshed-out story that contains typical amount of detail sounds more plausible than a stripped-down description of a situation that only states a few facts. There is a tendency for people to take that plausibility at face value, and assign [probability](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/probability) accordingly. This intuition is wrong, because the conjunction rule of probability theory states that, for any event X, its conjunction with additional details Y will be less probable.

The conjunction fallacy suggests that one should be [[Burdensome Details|very careful in adding details]] to any claim, as even though each such detail may make the claim so much more convincing, it also inevitably subtracts from its validity.
