# Akrasia

**Akrasia** is the state of acting against one's better judgment. A canonical example is procrastination.

Increasing [willpower](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/willpower) is seen by some as a solution to akrasia. On the other hand, many favor using tools such as [[Internal Double Crux]] to resolve internal mental conflicts until one *wants* to do the perform the reflectively endorsed task. The "resolve internal conflicts" approach is often related to viewing the mind in terms of [[Subagents|parts that disagree]] with each other.
