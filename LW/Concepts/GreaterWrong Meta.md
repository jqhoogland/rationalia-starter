# GreaterWrong Meta

**GreaterWrong** is an alternative front-end/viewer for the LessWrong site. The viewer is accessible at [www.greaterwrong.com](https://www.greaterwrong.com). The project uses the API of the main LessWrong project but is maintained independently by LessWrong users, [clone of saturn](https://www.lessestwrong.com/users/clone-of-saturn) and [Said Achmiz](https://www.lessestwrong.com/users/saidachmiz).
