**Moral Mazes** is a term for businesses where middle managers spend most of their time and energy on internal status competitions rather than improving the company's products. The phrase comes from [the book of the same name](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Mazes-World-Corporate-Managers/dp/0199729883) by Robert Jackall.
