The prisoner's dilemma (and its weaker varieties)—to cooperate or not to cooperate—is *the* fundamental problem of society.

There are several solutions to the PD's shitty Nash equilibrium:

1. **[[Tit for tat]]**
	1. **[[Iterated PD]]**: Play with the same person many times. Then, tit-for-tat can become the stable strategy. However, this becomes impossible when a society becomes large enough, esp. when it begins to insulate itself.
	2. **[[Distributed PD]]**: A pay-it-forward variety of the iterated PD. This requires the social network to have a short-enough average path that the benefit quickly returns to the agent.
2. **Reputation Networks**: A variety of the distributed PD that trades not immediate actions but social currency. It's probably less effective for the same reason negative enforcement is less effective than positive reinforcement
3. **[[The Mob Boss|Authority]]**: Give an agent a monopoly over force to punish detractors. This is a formalized and systematized version of the reputation network.
4. **[[Kill the ego]]**: Encourage the agents to identify with a larger unit that encompasses the two. Make the survival of the whole contingent on the cooperation of its pieces. Set it in opposition to some other system.
