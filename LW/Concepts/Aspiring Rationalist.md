# Aspiring Rationalist

An **aspiring rationalist** is one who seeks to follow the Way of Bayes, to believe what is true and do what it right, to update on the evidence and only on the evidence, wherever it may lead. Oftentimes just *rationalists*, the qualifier *aspiring* is often included to explicitly recognize just how far all human beings are from the ideal of normative reasoning.
