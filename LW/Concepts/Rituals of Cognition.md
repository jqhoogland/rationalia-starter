# Rituals of Cognition

**Rituals of Cognition**: a procedure, formal or informal, for arriving at some belief - when that procedure becomes valued for its own sake rather than as an instrument in arriving at "correct" (i.e. [winning](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/winning)) determinations.

Examples can include:

- causal decision theory in the context of Newcomb's problem
- statistical tools such as p-values in the context of experimental science
- majoritarianism in the context of arguments among would-be rationalists
