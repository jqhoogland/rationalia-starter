**Robust Agents** are decision-makers who can perform well in a variety of situations. Whereas some humans rely on folk wisdom or instinct, and some AIs might be designed to achieve a narrow set of goals, a Robust Agent has a coherent set of values and decision-procedures. This enables them to adapt to new circumstances (such as succeeding in a new environment, or responding to a new strategy by a competitor).
