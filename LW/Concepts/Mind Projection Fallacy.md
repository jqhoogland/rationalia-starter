# Mind Projection Fallacy

The **Mind Projection Fallacy** is the error of projecting the properties of your own mind onto the external world. For example, one might erroneously think that because they enjoy the taste of chocolate, the chocolate has the inherent property of tastiness, and therefore everyone else must like its taste too.

Overcoming the mind projection fallacy requires realizing that our minds are not transparent windows unto veridical reality; when you look at a rock, you experience not the the rock itself, but your mind's *representation* of the rock, reconstructed from photons bouncing off its surface. Sugar in and of itself is not *inherently* sweet; the sugar itself only has the chemical properties that it does, which your brain *interprets* as sweet.

## History

Physicist and [Bayesian](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/bayesianism) philosopher [E.T. Jaynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) coined the term *mind projection fallacy* to refer to this kind of failure to distinguish between epistemological claims (statements about belief, about your map, about what we can *say* about reality) and ontological claims (statements about reality, about the territory, about how things *are*). In particular, the concept was applied in the critique of [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) interpretation of the notion of [probability](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/probability) as a property of physical systems rather than an epistemic device concerned with levels of certainty, [Bayesian probability](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/bayesian-probability).
