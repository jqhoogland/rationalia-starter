> The error of projecting your mind onto the world.

**Cf.** [[Typical mind fallacy]] (projecting your mind onto other people.)

# Notes

- A failure to distinguish between [[Epistemology]] & [[Ontology]].
- Originally applied in critiquing Frequentism interpreting probability as a property rather than epistemic device Ã  la [[Bayesianism]].
