# Welcome Threads

If you are new to LessWrong, the current iteration of this, is the place to introduce yourself.

Personal stories, anecdotes, or just general comments on how you found us and what you hope to get from the site and community are invited.

This is also the place to discuss feature requests and other ideas you have for the site, if you don't want to write a full top-level post.
