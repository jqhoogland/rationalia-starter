# Meta-Honesty

**Meta-Honesty** is the attempt to be honest about in which situations one will not be honest. It derives from the recognition that an object-level commitment to never lie under any possible circumstance is untenable. A meta-honest person might say something like "I will lie in circumstances similar to an axe-wielding murderer coming to my door and enquiring after the location of my friend."
