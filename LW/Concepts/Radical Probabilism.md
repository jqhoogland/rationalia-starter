**Radical Probabilism** is a newer form of [[1 Projects/Rationalia/LW/Concepts/Bayesianism]] invented by [Richard Jeffrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jeffrey). The primary point of departure from other forms of Bayesianism is its rejection of the strong connection between conditional probability and updates. Radical Probabilism therefore rejects the strong connection between [[Bayes' Theorem|Bayes' Rule]] and updating.

Other notable writers on Radical Probabilism include Jeffrey's student [Richard Bradley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bradley_(philosopher)), and the champion of naturalized philosophy, [Brian Skyrms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Skyrms).
