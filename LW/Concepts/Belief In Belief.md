# Belief In Belief

**Belief in belief** is a situation where a model of the world you claim and believe to have is at odds with a model of the world that [[Technical Explanation|explains]] your actions and drives your [[Making Beliefs Pay Rent|anticipation of experience]]. You are always ready to provide an excuse for the next experiment not supporting your stated belief, because you know the outcome of the experiment in advance, but have to [[Rationalization|rationalize]] it in terms of the stated belief. Belief in belief can be seen as a form of [[Compartmentalization|compartmentalization]], which protects your actual model of the world from insane memes that survive as stated beliefs. Were you to [[Bite The Bullet|really believe]] and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe.
