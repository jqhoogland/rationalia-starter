Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a [[Note-Taking|note-taking]] method popular amongst some LWers, and often praised for its scalability.

A clear explanation can be found at abramdemski's post: [https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1)

> 🗃 The *Zettelkasten* is a workflow—*the* workflow—for writing.

# Why?

The *Zettelkasten* helps (1) separate signal from noise and (2) outsource thinking from brain.

- To prevent [[Blank page syndrome]]

 My Failures to Implement a Zettelkasten

Personal Knowledge Management System

> In January of 2020, the gurus of my digital bubble began preaching *personal knowledge management* (PKM)—vogue technobabble for "smarter note-taking."

[[Zettelkasten#Why]]

> Because I wanted a less atherosclerotic information pipeline, I heeded the instructions to take notes not in strict hierarchies but in flat networks. So that my note-taking might outsource my thinking from my brain and that I might separate the signal from the noise.

[[Atomic Workflows#The expectations are too high]]

> Of the many workflows under the PKM banner, one stood out: the *Zettelkasten*. Conceived by the intimidatingly prodigious sociologist Niklas Luhmann, this system seemed my surest route to informational detox. But try as I might, I couldn't get it to stick. My first *Zettelkasten* on Roam would collapse within a month. I moved on to Obsidian, where my first "vault" wouldn't last much longer. Nor the second vault, nor the third, nor the fourth. . . . I had never been an assiduous note-taker, and so I remained.

[[Atomic Workflows]], [[Zettelkasten as second brain]], [[Atomic Habits]]

> I came to the conclusion that the transition from capturing nothing to capturing everything had been too sudden. Taking a lesson from James Clear's [[Atomic Habits]], I needed to start smaller and build gradually. Because the aim—to clarify and share thinking—was too valuable to give up.

[[Writing focuses]]

> In this article, I'm going to take apart what an "atomic-workflows" treatment of the *Zettelkasten* might look like. I'm still at the start of this process, so I lack the experience that would vindicate or refute my hypotheses. But I write anyway because writing focuses attention like few other actions. Consider what I write provisional and stay tuned for future updates.

# Instructions (Simple)

The process of a *Zettelkasten* couldn't be much simpler:

1. 📝 Take notes the way you normally do (more or less).
2. 🗃 Decompose these notes into individual ideas, and turn these thoughts into complete sentences that fit on index cards (or their digital equivalents).
3. 🔗 Add links between conceptually related notes and mention the source.
4. 📌 Keep a few "index cards" to serve as entrypoints and overviews of common themes.

Then, when writing, all you need to do is find a relevant starting thought, follow the links, and copy any relevant information to a new page. Drafting becomes dragging-and-dropping.

Thus the writer avoids the two major pitfalls of poor writing:

- 🗒 **Blank page syndrome**: The struggle of getting started. Revising a draft is much easier than working from nothing.
- 📚 **[[Verbosity]]**: The struggle of saying too little with too many words. Maintaining atomic notes forces you to keep your ideas concise.

Of course, like any other workflow, there's more too it when you get into the details. But most of those details fit into the less than 150 pages of Sönke Ahren's *How to take smart notes*, a delightfully pithy read I recommend highly.

# Instructions (Full)

## Stages

There are three stages to the *Zettelkasten* (modified from Tiago Forte and Sönke Ahrens [@ahrens2017]):

1. 📝 Capturing
2. 🔗 Connecting
3. 💡 Creating

Restricting to Luhman's particular implementation, these stages further subdivide into a set of basic habits.

## Capturing

1. 📓 Gathering **literature notes**: These are notes you take while reading, watching, or listening to content. Don't copy verbatim, don't copy too much, and don't copy in isolation: take notes thinking of relevance beyond the margins of the page you're reading.
2. 💨 Gathering **fleeting notes**. These are the miscellaneous thoughts that arrive throughout the day. It's important to write these out and gather them in one place to process later for the same reason we use an inbox in [[GTD]]: to reduce the burden on our limited working memory.

## Connecting

1. 🗃 Making **permanent notes** from your fleeting notes and literature notes. With a second pass, revise and further reduce the first draft notes to discrete, indivisible chunks.
2. ✂️ **Linking and trimming**: Add links between related notes and make your notes accessible from logical entry points. Give yourself time to surf through your network to make new connections, expand thoughts, and remove notes that lose their relevancy or poignancy.

## Creating

1. 🏗 **Drafting**. Choose topics from the information you have rather than information you'd like to have. Drag and drop relevant notes (already worded in complete sentences) to a blank sheet (or screen) in a logical order, and modify for flow.
2. 💎 **Revising and Editing** the manuscript. Repeat until you're content (or at least things are no longer changing too much between drafts).
