**Infra-Bayesianism** is a new approach to [[Epistemology|epistemology]] / [decision theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/decision-theory) / reinforcement learning theory, which builds on "imprecise probability" to solve the problem of prior misspecification / grain-of-truth / nonrealizability which plagues [[1 Projects/Rationalia/LW/Concepts/Bayesianism|Bayesianism]] and Bayesian reinforcement learning.

Infra-Bayesianism also naturally leads to an implementation of [UDT](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/updateless-decision-theory), and (more speculatively at this stage) has applications to multi-agent theory, [[Embedded Agency|embedded agency]] and reflection.
