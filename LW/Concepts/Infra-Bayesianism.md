# Infra-Bayesianism

**Infra-Bayesianism** is a new approach to [[Epistemology|epistemology]] / [[Decision Theory|decision theory]] / reinforcement learning theory, which builds on "imprecise probability" to solve the problem of prior misspecification / grain-of-truth / nonrealizability which plagues [[Bayesianism]] and Bayesian reinforcement learning.

Infra-Bayesianism also naturally leads to an implementation of [[Updateless Decision Theory|UDT]], and (more speculatively at this stage) has applications to multi-agent theory, [[Embedded Agency|embedded agency]] and reflection.

See the [Infra-Bayesianism Sequence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zB4f7QqKhBHa5b37a/introduction-to-the-infra-bayesianism-sequence).
