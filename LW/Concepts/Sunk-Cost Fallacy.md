The **Sunk Cost Fallacy** is the tendency to consider costs that have already been paid and cannot be reclaimed when deciding whether to continue a project. Thinking you have to keep going because you've already put in so much. In reality, it is usually much more important to consider whether the benefits of finishing the project are worth more than the *remaining* costs.
