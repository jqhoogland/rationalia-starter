**Egalitarianism** is the idea that everyone should be considered equal. Equal in merit, equal in opportunity, equal in morality, and equal in achievement.

Dismissing egalitarianism is not opposed to [[Humility|humility]], even though from the [signaling](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/signaling) perspective it seems to be opposed to [[Humility|modesty]].
