# Egalitarianism

**Egalitarianism** is the idea that everyone should be considered equal. Equal in merit, equal in opportunity, equal in morality, and equal in achievement.

Dismissing egalitarianism is not opposed to [[Humility|humility]], even though from the [[Signaling|signaling]] perspective it seems to be opposed to [[Humility|modesty]].
