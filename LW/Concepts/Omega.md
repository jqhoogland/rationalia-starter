# Omega

**Omega** is a hypothetical super-intelligent being used in philosophical problems. Omega is most commonly used as the predictor in [[Newcomb's Problem|Newcomb's problem]]. Sometimes Omega is taken as a [[Perfect Predictor|perfect predictor]], while other times it is an almost perfect predictor. In some thought experiments, Omega is also taken to be super-powerful.

Omega can be seen as analogous to [Laplace's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_demon), or as the closest approximation to the Demon capable of existing in our universe. Including a perfect predictor in a problem can lead to subtle issues such particular counterfactuals being undefined. See the article on [[Perfect Predictor|Perfect Predictors]] for discussion of the technicalities and discussions about the validity of perfect predictors.
