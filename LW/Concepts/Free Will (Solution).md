# Free Will (Solution)

Since free will is about as easy as a philosophical problem in reductionism can get, while still appearing "impossible" to at least some philosophers, it makes a good exercise for aspiring reductionists, which *they should try on their own* \- see the main page on [[Free Will|free will]].

These posts **should not be read** until having made a very serious effort on your own.
