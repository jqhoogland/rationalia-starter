# Industrial Revolution

The **Industrial Revolution** was a set of economic and social changes that occurred in Europe and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, characterised by a transition from an "agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing" \[[1](https://www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution)\].Â
