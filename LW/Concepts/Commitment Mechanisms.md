A **Commitment Mechanism** is a tool or technique that lets people [[Pre-Commitment|pre-commit]] to something. an [assurance contract](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/assurance-contracts) is a Pre-Commitment done between several people which is conditional on other people also pre-committing.

Many commitment mechanisms incentivize following through on a commitment by penalizing failures to do so. For example, having to pay some amount of money, or automatically posting an announcement to your social media that you failed.
