Bayesianism is the broader philosophy inspired by [Bayes' theorem](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/bayes-theorem). The core claim behind all varieties of Bayesianism is that *probabilities are subjective degrees of belief --* often operationalized as willingness to bet.

This stands in contrast to other interpretations of probability, which attempt greater objectivity. The [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) interpretation of probability has a focus on repeatable *experiments;* probabilities are *the limiting frequency of an event if you performed the experiment an infinite number of times*. …[(Read More)]()

# Confirmation

Bayesian evidence cannot confirm a theory, it only establishes relative likelihoods.

It's easier to do Bayesian updates with odds ratios than with probabilities (but harder to add).

They are related by:

$$ P = O / (1 + O) \iff O = P / (1 - P)$$

Cox's Theorem

Jaynes recommends using log odds with addition where the distance between two degrees of uncertainty is the amount of evidence needed to go from one to the other.

Yudkowsky proposes throwing out probabilities 0 & 1 (analogously to rejecting $\infty$ from the integers). This would make it to marginalize over joint probabilities.
