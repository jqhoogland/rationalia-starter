# Orgasmium

**Orgasmium** (also known as **hedonium**) is a homogeneous substance with limited consciousness, which is in a constant state of supreme bliss. An AI programmed to "maximize happiness" might simply tile the universe with orgasmium. Some who believe this consider it a good thing; others do not. Those who do not, use its undesirability to argue that not all terminal values reduce to "happiness" or some simple analogue. Hedonium is the [[hedonism|hedonistic]] [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]]'s version of [[utilitronium]].
