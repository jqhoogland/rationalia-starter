# Longtermism

Longtermism is a philosophy that future lives matter and that we have a similar obligation to them as we do to lives around currently. William Macaskill states it in three clauses:Â 

*   Future people count
*   There could be a lot of them
*   We can make their lives go better

\[broad description of philosophy, something about WWOTF\]

Criticisms and responses
------------------------

*   Criticism: Longermism suffers from all the standard criticism of consequentialism
    *   Response: Longtermism doesn't require consequentialist assumptions. Many individuals and societies have felt an obligation towards their decendents
    *   Response: Many criticisms of consequentialism are baseless \[\[criticisms of consequentialism\]\]
    
*   Future lives don't exist, how could we care about them
