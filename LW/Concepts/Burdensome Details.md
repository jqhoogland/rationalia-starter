# Burdensome Details

The conjunction rule of probability theory states that a conjunction (A and B) is necessarily less probable than one of the conjuncts alone (A). Adding more details to a theory may make it sound *more plausible* to human ears because of the [[Representativeness Heuristic|representativeness heuristic]], even as the story becomes normatively less probable, as **burdensome details** drive the probability of the conjunction down (this is known as [[Conjunction Fallacy|conjunction fallacy]]). Any detail you add has to be pinned down by a sufficient amount of evidence; all the details you make no claim about can be summed over.
