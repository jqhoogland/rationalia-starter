**The pointers problem** refers to the fact that most humans would rather have [an AI that acts based on real-world human values](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/outer-alignment?showPostCount=true), not just human estimates of their own values â€“ and that the two will be different in many situations, since humans are not all-seeing or all-knowing. It was introduced in [a post with the same name](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gQY6LrTWJNkTv8YJR/the-pointers-problem-human-values-are-a-function-of-humans).
