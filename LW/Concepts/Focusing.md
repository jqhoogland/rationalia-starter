**Focusing** refers to a family of introspective techniques taught by [[Center for Applied Rationality (CFAR)|CFAR]] whose aim is to access one's "gut" or "[System 1](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/dual-process-theory-system-1-and-system-2?useTagName=false)" feelings. Archetypically, sensations within the body are approached with a spirit of gentle curiosity, and possible verbal labels are checked against felt senses. Where successful, this can improve internal understanding and allow split off trauma or conflict between [[Subagents|subagents]] to be processed for improved [internal alignment](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/internal-alignment-human).

Focusing draws in name from the [book and technique](https://www.amazon.com/Focusing-Eugene-T-Gendlin/dp/0553278339) of the same name by psychologist Eugene Gendlin (Who's also known on LessWrong for the [Litany of Gendlin](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/litany-of-gendlin)), and since his introduction, some have developed their own variations \[[1](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics)\].
