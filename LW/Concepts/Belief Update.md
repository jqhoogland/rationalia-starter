What you do to your beliefs, opinions and cognitive structure when new [[Evidence|evidence]] comes along.

[Cox's theorem](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cox's_theorem) says, roughly, that if your beliefs at any given time take the form of an assignment of a numerical "plausibility score" to every proposition, and if they satisfy a few plausible axioms, then your plausibilities must effectively be probabilities obeying the usual laws of probability theory, and your updating procedure must be the one implied by [[Bayes' Theorem|Bayes' theorem]].
