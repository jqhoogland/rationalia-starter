# Scope Insensitivity

The human brain can't *emotionally* represent large quantities; an environmental measure that will save 200,000 birds doesn't conjure anywhere near a hundred times the emotional impact and willingness-to-pay of a measure that would save 2,000 birds, even though *in fact* the former measure *is* two orders of magnitude more effective.
