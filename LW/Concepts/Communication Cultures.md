# Communication Cultures

A **Communication Culture** is a set of norms, expectations, and assumptions that a group of people adopts around communication. It is probable that some Communication Cultures are objectively better than others, but is definite that difficult clashes occur when people operating under different cultures interact.

Awareness of Communication Cultures is therefore key to getting along with others not perfectly sharing our background and preferences.

Notable Communication Cultures (these are usually contrasted along some dimension) are: [Ask vs Guess](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/vs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy/ask-and-guess) (and [Tell](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/rEBXN3x6kXgD4pLxs/tell-culture)/[Reveal](https://malcolmocean.com/2015/06/reveal-culture/)); [Wait vs Interrupt](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/LuXb6CZG4x7pDRBP8/wait-vs-interrupt-culture); and [Combat vs Nurture](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/ExssKjAaXEEYcnzPd/conversational-cultures-combat-vs-nurture-v2).
