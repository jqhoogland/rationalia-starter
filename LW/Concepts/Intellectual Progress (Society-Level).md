# Intellectual Progress (Society-Level)

**Intellectual Progress** is the progressive accumulation of knowledge. Questions include *How is intellectual progress made?* and *How do we make more?* [[Intellectual Progress (Individual-Level)]] and the [[Scholarship & Learning]] tag is focused on the learning and research of individuals. In contrast, Intellectual Progress (Society-Level) is about how we, humanity, collectively make progress on important questions. What broader conditions, institutions, and technologies enable progress?
