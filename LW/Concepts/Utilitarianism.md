**Utilitarianism** is a moral [[Philosophy|philosophy]] that says that what matters is the sum of everyone's welfare, or the "greatest good for the greatest number".

Not to be confused with maximization of [utility](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/utility-functions), or [expected utility](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/expected-utility). If you're a utilitarian, you don't just sum over [possible worlds](https://www.lessestwrong.com/tag/possible-world); you sum over *people*.

Utilitarianism comes in different variants. For example, unlike standard [total utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_utilitarianism), [average utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_utilitarianism) values the *average* utility among a group's members. [Negative utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/utilitarianism#Negative_utilitarianism) seeks only to minimize suffering, and is often discussed for its extreme implications.
