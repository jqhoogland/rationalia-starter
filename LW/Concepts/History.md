# History

History: "Why should I remember the Wright Brothers’ first flight? I was not there. But as a rationalist, could I dare to not remember, when the event actually happened? Is there so much difference between seeing an event through your eyes—which is actually a causal chain involving reflected photons, not a direct connection—and seeing an event through a history book? Photons and history books both descend by causal chains from the event itself." - Eliezer Yudkowsky, [*Making History Available*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TLKPj4GDXetZuPDH5/making-history-available).
