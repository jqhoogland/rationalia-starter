# AI Services (CAIS)

An **AI service** as used in the context of Eric Drexler's technical report [Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services as General Intelligence](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Reframing_Superintelligence_FHI-TR-2019-1.1-1.pdf?asd=sa) (CAIS), is an AI system that delivers bounded results for some task using bounded resources in bounded time. It is contrasted with agentive AGI, which carries out open-ended goals over an unbounded period of time.

A gradual accumulation of increasingly competent services is one model of how AI might develop. For a summary, see [this post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x3fNwSe5aWZb5yXEG/reframing-superintelligence-comprehensive-ai-services-as).
