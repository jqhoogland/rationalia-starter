# The Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom Debate

In late 2008, an extensive and long-awaited debate about the [Technological Singularity](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Technological_Singularity) occurred on [[Overcoming Bias]], mainly between [[Robin Hanson]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]]. It focused on the likelihood of [hard AI takeoff](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/hard_takeoff) (**"**[**FOOM**](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/FOOM)**"**), the need for a theory of [Friendliness](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Friendly_AI), and the future of [AGI](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/AGI), [[Whole Brain Emulation|whole brain emulation]], and [[Recursive Self-Improvement|recursive self-improvement]] in general. A stand-up debate on the same themes took place at *Jane Street Capital* in June 2011, and Hanson made a further post in 2014.
