# Logic & Mathematics

**Logic and Mathematics** are deductive systems, where the conclusion of a successful argument follows necessarily from its premises, given the axioms of the system youâ€™re using: number theory, geometry, predicate logic, etc.

## See Also

- [[Valid Argument|Valid argument]] \- An argument is valid when it contains no logical fallacies
- [[Sound Argument|Sound argument]] \- an argument that is valid and whose premises are all true. In other words, the premises are true and the conclusion necessarily follows from them, making the conclusion true as well.
- [[Formal Proof|Formal proof]] \- A set of steps from axiom(s) and previous proof(s) which follows the rules of induction of a mathematical system.
