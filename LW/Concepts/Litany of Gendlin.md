# Litany of Gendlin

> The **Litany of Gendlin**:
> *What is true is already so.*
> *Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.*
> *Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.*
> *And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.*
> *Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.*
> *People can stand what is true,*
> *for they are already enduring it.*

> â€”[Eugene Gendlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin)
