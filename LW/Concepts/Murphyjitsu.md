# Murphyjitsu

> In the course of making plans, Murphyjitsu is the practice of strengthening plans by repeatedly envisioning and defending against failure modes until you would be *shocked* to see it fail. Here’s the basic setup of Murphyjitsu:

> 1\. Make a plan.

> 2\. Imagine that you’ve passed the deadline and find out that the plan failed.

> 3\. If you’re *shocked* in this scenario, you’re done.

> 4\. Otherwise, simulate the most likely failure mode, defend against it, and repeat.
