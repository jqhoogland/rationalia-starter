# [[Philosophy]]

Physics is rooted in the concept of **[[Physical Law]]**:

- These are unchanging relations (though often formulated as approximations) that describe the structure and evolution of the universe.
- cf. Neoplatonism

These laws are **mathematical**:

> “Philosophy \[nature\] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.” — Galileo

> "Why can we use mathematics to describe nature without a mechanism behind it? No one knows. We have to keep going because we find out more that way."

They are not always clear or immediately apparent. But we can uncover them through a careful combination of [[Rationality]] & [[Empiricism]].

[[Mystery]] & Sense of wonder

> "It does no harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! Why do the poets of the present not speak of it? What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent?" — [[Richard Feynman]]

> "It is characteristic of physical laws that they have this abstract character … with no mention of machinery."

# Themes

## 1. [[Symmetry & Conservation]]

Linked by Noether's theorem.

It is only possible to speak of things of things that change in reference to those that don't. Conservation laws describe precisely these references.

Moreover, symmetries set extreme constraints on allowable descriptive theories. They reduce the search space so thoroughly that we can be bold enough to dare at a fundamental theory.

## 2. [[Duality]]

## 3. Topology

## Concepts

Following the structure [[Richard Feynman]]'s lecture series.

### [[Atomic Hypothesis]]

> "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed onto the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the *atomic hypothesis* (or the atomic *fact*, or whatever you wish to call it) that *all things are made up of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another*. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an *enormous* amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied."

## Fundamental Physics

> "[T]he world" Something like a great chess game being played by the gods, and we are observers of the game. We do not know what the rules of the game are; all we are allowed to do is to watch the playing. Of course, if you watch long enough, we may eventually catch on to a few of the rules. The rules of the game or what we mean by fundamental physics. Even if we knew every rule, however, we might not be able to understand why a particular move is made in the game, merely because it is too complicated and our minds are limited.

How can we tell which rules are right?

1. Exact tests when nature lets us isolate its parts.
2. To derive less specific rules (e.g., the diagonal moves of a bishop confine it to either black or white squares)
3. By rough approximation

### [[Unificationism|unification]]

The problem in basic theoretical physics is "to find the laws behind experiment; to amalgamate these classes. Historically, we've always been able to amalgamate them, but as time goes on new things are found."

## History of Physics

Broadly, there are two periods.

- Physics before 1920: Classical mechanics; Galilean Relativity
	- Inertia & Forces
	- Deterministic
	- Gravity
	- Electromagnetism
- Physics after 1920: Quantum mechanics; Special & General Relativity
	- Conservation & symmetry
	- Stochastic
	- Weak & Strong forces

## Relation to Other Sciences

See also: [[The arrogance of physicists]]

From most fundamental to most derived:

- [[Physics]]
- Astronomy
- Geology

- Chemistry
- [[Biology]]
	- Besides evolution, free energy is as close to a central theme in biology as you can get.

- [[Psychology]]
- [[Sociology]]

Physics is often a source of experimental and data-driven techniques.
