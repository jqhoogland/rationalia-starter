# Computing Overhang
Computing overhang refers to a situation where new algorithms can exploit existing computing power far more efficiently than before. This can happen if previously used algorithms have been suboptimal.

In the context of [[1 Projects/Learning/Rationalism/Concepts/Artificial General Intelligence]], this signifies a situation where it becomes possible to create AGIs that can be run using only a small fraction of the easily available hardware resources. This could lead to an [[Intelligence Explosion|intelligence explosion]], or to a massive increase in the number of AGIs, as they could be easily copied to run on countless computers. This could make AGIs much more powerful than before, and present an [[1 Projects/Learning/Rationalism/Concepts/Existential Risk|existential risk]].

## Examples
In 2010, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology [reported on](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-nitrd-report-2010.pdf) benchmark production planning model having become faster by a factor of 43 million between 1988 and 2003. Of this improvement, only a factor of roughly 1,000 was due to better hardware, while a factor of 43,000 came from algorithmic improvements. This clearly reflects a situation where new programming methods were able to use available computing power more efficiently....[(Read More)]()
