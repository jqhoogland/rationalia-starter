# Population Ethics

**Population Ethics** addresses the question: how should utilitarians deal with *people coming in and out of existence?*Â 

For example, a classical problem in population ethics: is it overall better for a happy person to exist, if they bring down the *average* happiness but increase the *total*? Those who would answer "yes" are termed *total (hedonic) utilitarians*; those who would answer "no" are termed *average (hedonic) utilitarians.*

Note that [utility is not comparable](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cYsGrWEzjb324Zpjx/comparing-utilities), so we cannot simply speak of "increasing average utility" vs "increasing total utility". Hence, *average utilitarianism* vs *total utilitarianism* is not a well-defined distinction in the abstract; we have to specify e.g. *hedonic* utilitarianism before this distinction becomes well-defined (because average vs total happiness is a meaningful distinction).

However, although preference-utilitarians cannot necessarily make a meaningful distinction between averaging and totaling, they do not escape population-ethics dilemmas. It's still a fair question: when is it overall preferable to bring someone into existence (or for someone to pass out of existence)? What can/should ethics say about this?
