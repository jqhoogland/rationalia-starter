# The Utility Function Is Not Up For Grabs

The constraints of decision theory are only there to help you win; they don't specify what constitutes a win. Rationality in and of itself cannot constrain what you want, except insofar as what you thought you wanted failed to reflect what you actually wanted (or was just plain inconsistent). Hence the saying: **the utility function is not up for grabs**.
