# Transformative AI
Transformative AI is "AI that precipitates a transition comparable to (or more significant than) the agricultural or industrial revolution" ([link](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/some-background-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence#Sec1)). This is similar in nature to [[Superintelligence|Superintelligent AI]] or [[1 Projects/Learning/Rationalism/Concepts/Artificial General Intelligence]] but separates out the transformative nature of the AI from the mechanism by which the transformation occurs.
