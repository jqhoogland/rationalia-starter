# Lawful Intelligence

The startling and counterintuitive notion - contradicting both surface appearances and all [Deep Wisdom](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Deep_Wisdom) \- that intelligence is a manifestation of Order rather than Chaos. Even creativity and [outside-the-box thinking](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/outside_the_box) are essentially lawful.

While this is a complete heresy according to the standard religion of Silicon Valley, there are some good mathematical reasons for believing it.
