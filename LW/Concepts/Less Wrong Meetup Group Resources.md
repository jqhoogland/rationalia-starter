# Less Wrong Meetup Group Resources

Less Wrong members sometimes arrange [meetups](http://lesswrong.com/tag/meetup/?sort=new) (or "dojos") to meet each other in [meatspace](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace). Some geographic areas have groups that do this [regularly](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups). This page lists tips and resources for Less Wrong meetup groups.

[How to Run a Successful Less Wrong Meetup](http://lesswrong.com/lw/crs/how_to_run_a_successful_less_wrong_meetup/) is a extended primer on running meetups, but starting one is actually very [easy](http://lesswrong.com/lw/43s/starting_a_lw_meetup_is_easy). Another great place to get information is [Maia's Meetup Cookbook](https://tigrennatenn.neocities.org/meetup_cookbook.html).

If you are a meetup organizer or interested in starting a meetup, consider signing up for the LW Organizers mailing list [here](http://groups.google.com/group/lw-organizers). The mailing list has a [thread about sharing materials](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/lw-organizers/gdgCVHqvjjE/discussion).

There is also a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LesswrongOrganizers/) for organisers to talk to each other

Most of this data comes from the post [Less Wrong NYC: Case Study of a Successful Rationalist Chapter](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4ul/less_wrong_nyc_case_study_of_a_successful/). (For more on Less Wrong NYC, see [Epistle to the New York Less Wrongians](http://lesswrong.com/lw/5c0/epistle_to_the_new_york_less_wrongians/).)

## Organization Tips

- **Communities need heroes**. Most people will be passively attending. Step up.
- **Commitment works**. Announce regular dates and times, and stay for a minimum length of time, regardless of attendance.
- **Schedule events first, get feedback later**. Getting everyone to state their preferences up front leads to prolonged indecision.
- **Be a group of friends**. Meet regularly. Do things you like doing, together. Be a community. Set goals and hold each other accountable. Be honest. Make use of each person's skills and knowledge.
- **Gender ratio matters**. Treat others with respect. Be mindful of exclusionary language.
- **Use the mailing list for more than just meetup scheduling**.
- **Interact with outside rationalists as much as possible**.
- **Congregate in the area nearby with the most Less Wrongers**.
- **Use good meetup descriptions.** Here is an [example meetup description](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Y3KCuqJSbpGs62Hvp/example-meetup-description).

## Meetup Activities

- **Social / unfocused discussions**. Attendance is usually poor; members report that hanging out is harder to justify than having a specific purpose.
- **Specific discussion topics**. Attendance is good. Break into small groups to make better progress. Here are some resources for finding discussion topics:
    - [London Rationalish Readings](https://sackeyjason.github.io/london-rationalish-readings/)
    - [Seattle Reading Group Notes](https://palegreendot.net/)
    - [Log of Ottawa's past meetups on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rationalottawa/files/docs)
- **Presentation / skill training**. Attendance is good if the topic interests many people.
- **Game nights**. This can include rationality training games like [Biased Pandemic](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ar2/biased_pandemic/), [Paranoid Debating](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paranoid_debating), and [poker](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4yk/verifying_rationality_via_rationalpokercom/).
- **Group planning / meta**. Usually just for group leaders.
- **Structured exercises**. Attendance varies. Example from NYC Less Wrong: [Fun and Games with Cognitive Biases](http://lesswrong.com/lw/4fp/fun_and_games_with_cognitive_biases/).
- **Party time**.

## Discussion Topics

- Tell your rationalist success story.
- Basics of rationality.
- Cognitive biases.
- The sequences.
- Decision theory.
- Friendly AI.
