**Least convenient possible world** (or **LCPW**) is a technique for enforcing intellectual honesty, to be used when arguing against an idea. The essence of the technique is to assume that all the specific details will align with the idea against which you are arguing, i.e. to consider the idea in the context of a least convenient [[Possible World|possible world]], where every circumstance is colluding against your objections and counterarguments. This approach ensures that your objections are [strong enough](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/epistemic-hygiene), running minimal risk of being [[Rationalization|rationalizations]] for your [position](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/blues-and-greens-metaphor).
