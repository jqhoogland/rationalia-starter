# Disagreement

**Disagreement** is when two people have different beliefs.

Aumann's Agreement Theorem
--------------------------

Considered of particular relevance to disagreement between people trying to be rational, [Aumann's agreement theorem](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/aumann-s-agreement-theorem) can be [informally interpreted](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/aumann-agreement) as suggesting that if two people are honest seekers of truth, and both *believe* each other to be honest, then they should update on each other's opinions and quickly reach agreement. The very fact that a person believes something is [Rational evidence](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/rational-evidence) that that something is true, and so this fact [should be taken into account](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/01/extraordinary_c.html) when forming your belief.

Outside of well-functioning [prediction markets](https://lessestwrong.com/tag/prediction-markets), Aumann agreement can probably only be approximated by careful deliberative discourse. Interest in Aumann agreement has waned in recent years within the Rationalist community, perhaps out of a sense Aumann agreement cannot be practically achieved by humans â€“ there is too much background information to be exchanged. Instead, people now focus on things more like Double-Crux
