# Joy In Discovery

**Joy in discovery** is the pleasure of figuring things out need not be restricted to professional researchers doing cutting-edge science. The fact that a particular truth has been discovered by someone doesn't mean that particular truth is forever marked with a little XML tag that says <**KNOWN**>. Knowledge is [[Evidence|evidential entanglement]] between brains and environments; in a [disconnected world](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/No_one_knows_what_science_doesn't_know) where it's [[Illusion of Transparency|difficult]] to [[Inferential Distance|explain]] things, it's hard to see how **joy in discovery** could feasibly be reserved for one discoverer. The fact that someone else's beliefs are evidentially entangled with their environment doesn't mean that yours can't be, *too*. Many [[Aspiring Rationalist|aspiring rationalists]] find this (coupled with certain [[Fun Theory|fun-theoretic]] concerns) a compelling argument for taking joy in every personal discovery, delighting in the truth-finding process without undue concern about what *other* people already know. Your mileage may vary.
