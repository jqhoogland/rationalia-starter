# Reductionism

**Reductionism** is a disbelief that the higher levels of simplified multilevel models are out there in the [territory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/territory), that concepts constructed by mind in themselves play a role in the behavior of reality. This doesn't contradict the notion that the concepts used in simplified multilevel models refer to the actual clusters of configurations of reality.
