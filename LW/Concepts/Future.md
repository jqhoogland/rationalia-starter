# Future

If it hasn't happened yet but is going to, then it's part of the [[Future|future]]. Checking whether or not something is going to happen is notoriously difficult. Luckily, the field of [[Heuristics & Biases|heuristics and biases]] has given us some insights into what can go wrong. Namely, one problem is that the future elicits [[Near/Far Thinking|far mode]], which isn't about truth-seeking or gritty details.
