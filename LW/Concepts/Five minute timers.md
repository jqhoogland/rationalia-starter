# Five Minute Timers

**Five minute timers.** Sometimes, all you need to solve an impossible problem is to actually think for 5 minutes. (Sometimes it is actually 15 minutes, or two hours. But, the first five minutes is helpful for transforming it from an inpenetrable ugh field to a tractable problem)

Sometimes called Yoda timers. (A timebox wherein you Actually Try)
