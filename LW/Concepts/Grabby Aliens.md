# Grabby Aliens

**Grabby Aliens** is a theory that explains why humans appeared relatively early in the history of the universe (13.8 *billion* years after the Big Bang, while the average star will last over five *trillion* years). It was developed by Robin Hanson, Daniel Martin, Calvin McCarter, and Jonathan Paulson.
