**Cost Disease** or **Baumol's cost disease** is a name for the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor productivity \[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease)\]. Some use the term generally to refer to rising costs in general \[[2](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BBQ5HEnL3ShefQxEj/considerations-on-cost-disease)\].

Often the questions being asked in Cost Disease discussion are why the cost healthcare and education have increased many, many times over.
