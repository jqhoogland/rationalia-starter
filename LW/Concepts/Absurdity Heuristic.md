# Absurdity Heuristic

The **absurdity heuristic** classifies highly untypical situations as "absurd", or [[Antiprediction|impossible]]. While normally very useful as a form of [[Epistemic Hygiene|epistemic hygiene]], allowing us to detect nonsense, it suffers from the same problems as the [[Representativeness Heuristic|representativeness heuristic]].

There are a number of situations in which the absurdity heuristic is wrong. A deep theory has to [[Shut Up and Multiply|override the intuitive expectation]]. Where you don't expect intuition to construct an [[Technical Explanation|adequate model]] of reality, classifying an idea as impossible may be [[Overconfidence|overconfident]]. [The future is usually "absurd"](http://lesswrong.com/lw/j1/stranger_than_history/), although sometimes it's possible to [[Exploratory Engineering|rigorously infer low bounds on capabilities of the future]], proving possible what is intuitively absurd.
