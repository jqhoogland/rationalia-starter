# Improving the LessWrong Wiki

- This is a deliberate bastardisation and subversion of how the wiki is used
- In order that people don't think I'm a defector, I'm making clear what I'm doing as I'm doing it. Tell me what you think
- Anyone should still edit this document as if it were theirs
- The wiki would be better if it had a range of features I discuss below
- If you disagree, edit it! Sometimes edit wars are good

Wiki features and how valuable they would be
============================================

- Comments on wikis
    - The current tech exists and it would make it much cleaner to write things I intend to work on in future.
    - Comments are hidden unless you click show. You can toggle them to be permanently shown
- Double bracket search and tagging 
    - When you use \[\[, it opens up a search window to all Lesswrong tags. You type in what you want to reference. If there isn't one. it creates it eg  \[\[Solipsism\]\]
- Disputed changes sit beside text, like comments
- A process for requesting a number -> getting an accurate forecast
    - There is a description in the text
    - A user flags it for quantification
    - Other users collaboratively write a forecasting question
    - Users give estimates, weighted by LW karma score (I hate this but it would be better than nothing, hard to abuse etc)
    - Ideally, eventually this gets replaced by a manifold market or similar
- Toggle hide/unhide sections
- Gwern-style floating windows which appear when you hover over text in Lesswrong
- Embeddable manifold markets
- Embeddable squiggle estimation
- Taking variables from manifold markets and squiggle and displaying them within the text

Some pages I have edited to be the style of what I think should be all pages
============================================================================

- [[Effective Altruism|https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism]]
    - It now has a section on funding use, impact and criticims
    - With a little more work I think it could be the best single page introduction to EA
- [[Forecasting & Prediction|https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/forecasting-and-prediction]]
    - A better overview of the topic
