# Fuzzies

A **fuzzy** is a hypothetical measurement unit for "warm fuzzy feeling" one gets from believing that one has done good. Unlike [utils](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/utils), fuzzies can be earned through psychological tricks without regard for efficiency. For this reason, it may be a good idea to separate the concerns for actually doing good, for which one might need to [[Shut Up and Multiply|shut up and multiply]], and for earning fuzzies, to get psychological comfort.
