# Semantic Stopsign

A **semantic stopsign** or **curiosity stopper** is a meaningless, generic explanation that creates the illusion of giving an answer, without actually explaining anything. Semantic stopsigns destroy [[Curiosity|curiosity]], giving surrogate answers and stopping the search for [[Truth, Semantics, & Meaning|truth]] prematurely. Can preserve [[Improper Belief|incorrect beliefs]] for a long time, insisting on following [[Cached Thoughts|cached thought]] without rethinking anything. A tool of [[Dark Arts|dark arts]] and an important part of any [[Anti-Epistemology|anti-epistemology]].

When specific words act as stopsigns, placing a [[Rationalist Taboo|rationalist taboo]] on them may help. [[Epistemic Hygiene|Epistemic hygiene]] allows excluding some of the stopsigns raised by [[Arguments As Soldiers|partial arguers]] or by your own [cognitive biases](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/cognitive_biases).
