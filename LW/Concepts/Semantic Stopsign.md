A **semantic stopsign** or **curiosity stopper** is a meaningless, generic explanation that creates the illusion of giving an answer, without actually explaining anything. Semantic stopsigns destroy [[Curiosity|curiosity]], giving surrogate answers and stopping the search for [truth](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/truth-semantics-and-meaning) prematurely. Can preserve [[Improper Belief|incorrect beliefs]] for a long time, insisting on following [cached thought](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/cached-thought) without rethinking anything. A tool of [[Dark Arts|dark arts]] and an important part of any [anti-epistemology](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/anti-epistemology).

When specific words act as stopsigns, placing a [[Rationalist Taboo|rationalist taboo]] on them may help. [Epistemic hygiene](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/epistemic-hygiene) allows excluding some of the stopsigns raised by [[Arguments As Soldiers|partial arguers]] or by your own [cognitive biases](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/cognitive_biases).
