# Kelly Criterion

the **Kelly criterion** (or **Kelly strategy** or **Kelly bet**), also known as the scientific gambling method, is a [formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula) for bet sizing that leads [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely) to higher wealth compared to any other strategy in the long run (i.e. approaching the limit as the number of bets goes to infinity). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion))
