# Humans Consulting HCH

**Humans Consulting HCH (HCH)** is a recursive acronym describing a setup where humans can consult simulations of themselves to help answer questions. It is a concept used in discussion of the [[Iterated Amplification |iterated amplification]] proposal to solve the alignment problem.

It was first described by Paul Christiano in his post [Humans Consulting HCH](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NXqs4nYXaq8q6dTTx/humans-consulting-hch):

> 
> That is, Hugh is able to consult a copy of Hugh, who is able to consult a copy of Hugh, who is able to consult a copy of Hugh…
> 
> Let’s call this process HCH, for “Humans Consulting HCH.”
