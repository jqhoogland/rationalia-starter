# Trigger-Action Planning

**Trigger-Action Planning (**TAP), sometimes **Trigger-Action Patterns**, and formerly **Implementation Intentions** are techniques for getting oneself to successfully enact desired actions (or inactions) by training something like a "stimulus-response" pair. The technique was spread by CFAR which initially drew upon the psychology literature of Implementation Intentions.Â 

After it was clear that TAPs should be heavily applied to cognitive motions/thought patterns, some decided that the 'P' should stand for 'Pattern' rather than 'Plan'.

## **Resources**

- The CFAR Participant Handbook \[1\] contains a chapter on TAPs.
- Brienne Yudkowsky's writings on the topic of Noticing, found mostly at her blog \[[1](https://agentyduck.blogspot.com/search?q=noticing)\], are particularly good material related to training TAPs.
