# Map and Territory
Models of reality are often mistaken for reality itself, and clarifying the distinction is an important rationalist technique.

### General semantics
This is the guiding tenet of Alfred Korzybski's  (1879–1950) **general semantics**. 

1. A word is not the thing it represents
	=> "*The map is not the territory.*"
2. Words cannot say everything about anything
	=> "*A map does not represent the entire territory.*"
3. Words are self-reflexive (explaining them requires other words requiring others . . . )
	=> "*A map would have to include a map of the map, which in turn would have to include a map of the map of the map, etc.*"
	
This is Parrish's first choice for his set of mental models. 

### All models are wrong
>"All models are wrong, but some are useful" (George Box in 1976).

Parrish uses "map" interchangeably with "model."
He draws a parallel between "map" and "[[Paradigm]]" à la [[Kuhnianism]].

This more extreme formulation puts me on my guard because I fear it perpetuating a meek [[Constructivism]]. Saying that "all models are wrong" is not helpful. It's obvious that we will never describe systems of Avogadran quantity exactly. When we belabor that models are "wrong," we risk lapsing into [[Anti-scientism]] and undermining the quest towards [[A fundamental theory]].
