# Consensus

A **Consensus** is a general or full agreement between members of a group. A consensus can be useful in deciding what's true (e.g, a scientific consensus), or as a criteria in decision making. A **False Consensus** can happen when someone thinks a position is in consensus when it isn't. one can also claim a consensus falsely to advance their position and make it difficult for others to oppose it. a **False Controversy** can happen when one mistakes something to not be in consensus when in fact it is. Claiming false controversies is a common way of creating uncertainty and doubt.

There are many things that are considered a consensus on LessWrong, even though they're are not considered a consensus in the scientific community, such as: [[One-Boxing]], cooperating on the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]],  [[Bayesianism]] over [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) probability (and more to be added)

Notable things that *aren't* in consensus on LessWrong include [[ Extortion]], [[Value of Rationality|the benefits of rationality]], [[AI Timelines]] and [[AI Takeoff]], as well as [AI alignment strategies](Friendly Artificial Intelligence),
