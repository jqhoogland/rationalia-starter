**Note! This is how submissions work for non-members of the AI Alignment Forum**

*If you are seeing this, you are not a full-member.*

*   If you post or comment, your submission will enter a review queue and a decision to accept or reject it from the Alignment Forum will be made within three days. If it is rejected, you will receive a minimum one-sentence explanation.
*   In the meantime (and regardless of outcome), your post or comment will be published to [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/). There it can be immediately viewed and discussed by everyone, and edited by you.

For more detail, see our [FAQ](https://alignmentforum.org/faq) where we answer questions like [*How can non-members participate in the Forum?*](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Yp2vYb4zHXEeoTkJc/welcome-and-faq#How_can_non_members_participate_in_the_Forum_) and [*How do I join the Alignment Forum?*](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Yp2vYb4zHXEeoTkJc/welcome-and-faq#How_do_I_join_the_Alignment_Forum_) Also feel free to shoot us a message via Intercom (bottom right of the page), or email us at team@lesswrong.com
