# Reflective Inconsistency

**Reflective inconsistency** refers to a disagreement between your earlier self and your later self about what your *earlier self* should have done given only your *earlier* state of knowledge. It can informally be called *regret* or *remorse*.

More precisely, if you do Y, and later you think "Knowing only what I knew before doing Y should have deterred me from doing Y,", then you are reflectively inconsistent.

## Examples

> Tuesday Self: <spends 5 dollars on a chance to win 6 dollars if a fair coin flip lands heads>
>
> Wednesday Self: "That wasn't worth the risk, and I should have known better."
>
> Tuesday Self: <spends 5 dollars on a chance to win 6 dollars if a fair coin flip lands heads>
>
> Wednesday Self: "That was lucky, but it wasn't worth the risk and I should have known better.>

Non-example:

> Tuesday Self: <spends 5 dollars on a chance to win 6 dollars if a fair coin flip lands heads>
>
> Wednesday Self: "I would have been better off not taking the bet, since the coin was going to land tails.>
