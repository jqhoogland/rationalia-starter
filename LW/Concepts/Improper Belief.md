# Improper Belief

An **improper belief** is a [[Belief|belief]] that isn't concerned with describing the [territory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/territory). A proper belief, on the other hand, [[Beliefs Require Observations|requires observations]], gets [[Belief Update|updated]] upon encountering new [[Evidence|evidence]], and [provides practical benefit](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/beliefs_pay_rent) in [[Technical Explanation|anticipated experience]].

Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a [[Lottery|lottery]] ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.
