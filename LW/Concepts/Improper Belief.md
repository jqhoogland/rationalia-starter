An improper belief is a [belief](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief) that isn't concerned with describing the [territory](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/territory). A proper belief, on the other hand, [requires observations](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/beliefs-require-observations), gets [updated](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/belief-update) upon encountering new [evidence](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/evidence), and [provides practical benefit](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/beliefs_pay_rent) in [anticipated experience](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/technical-explanation).

Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a [lottery](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/lottery) ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.
