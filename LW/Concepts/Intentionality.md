# Intentionality

# Intentional Stance

> The intentional stance is a term coined by philosopher Daniel Dennett for the level of abstraction in which we view the behavior of an entity in terms of mental properties ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance))

Paraphrased by [Richard Ngo](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/mzgtmmTKKn5MuCzFJ/p/bz5GdmCWj8o48726N): 
> "assigning agency to a system is a modelling choice which only applies at certain levels of abstraction"

Contrasted with the "physical stance" (physics, chemistry) and "design stance" or "teleological stance" (biology, engineering).
