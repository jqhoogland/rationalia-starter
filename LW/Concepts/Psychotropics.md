# Psychotropics

**Psychotropic substances** are substances that noticeably affect how people think. This tag is intended primarily for substances that cause short-term experiences that (used responsibly) can have long-term positive or net-neutral effects on one's intellectual, emotional, and "spiritual" growth. This includes psychedelics such as Psilocybin and LSD as central examples, as well as MDMA and Cannabis as less-central examples

Contrast with the tags [[Psychiatry]] and [[Nootropics & Other Cognitive Enhancement|Nootropics]], which also pertain to substances which affect people's cognition
