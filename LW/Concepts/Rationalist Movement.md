# Rationalist Movement

The **rationalist movement**, **rationality community**,[^1^](#fn1) **rationalsphere** or **rationalistsphere**[^2^](#fn2) represents a set of modes of [[Bayesianism|bayesian]] thinking from self-described [rationalists](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist) or '[[Aspiring Rationalist|aspiring rationalists]]' typically associated with the [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) [diaspora](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/diaspora) and their associated communities.

*This page was last properly edited in December 2017, around the time LW2.0 was getting started. It may not accurate reflect the state of affairs in 2020 – either culture or how the community sees itself. – Ruby*

## History

Following the wind-down of the first era of [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) in 2014, triggered primarily via the departure of [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] and other top writers, the formerly closer-knit on and offline groups continue with a lessened central focus.

Arguably, [[Scott Alexander]] has emerged as the most influential remaining figurehead and [[Slate Star Codex]] commands the highest single point of engagement within the restructured community.

In 2016-2017, discussion of revival occurred and Vaniver was made benevolent dictator for life. He in turn empowered Oliver Habryka to form a team and launch the LessWrong 2.0 project which runs the current site.

## Illustration

This is a fertile land and we will thrive. We will rule over all this land! And we will call it...this land!

A popular illustration of the communities comprising and related to the movement was created in 2014 on [[Slate Star Codex]][^3^](#fn3)[^4^](#fn4) (above).

A 2017 conceptual Venn diagram of the 'rationalsphere' has also been created.[^5^](#fn5)

## Definitions

[[Scott Alexander]] has also suggested the following definition in 2016:[^6^](#fn6)

> The rationalist community is a group of people (of which I’m a part) who met reading the site [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) and who tend to [hang out together online](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/diaspora), [sometimes hang out together in real life](https://www.lesswrong.com/about_meetup_groups), and tend to befriend each other, work with each other, date each other, and generally move in the same social circles. Some people[^7^](#fn7) call it a cult, but that’s more a sign of some people having lost vocabulary for anything between “totally atomized individuals” and “outright cult” than any [[Phyg|particular cultishness]].
> 
> But people keep asking me what exactly the rationalist community is. Like, what is the thing they believe that makes them rationalists? It can’t just be about being [rational](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalism), because loads of people are interested in that and most of them aren’t part of the community. And it can’t just be about [[Transhumanism|transhumanism]] because there are a lot of transhumanists who aren’t rationalists, and lots of rationalists who aren’t transhumanists. And it can’t just be about [[Bayesianism]], because pretty much everyone, rationalist or otherwise, agrees that is a kind of statistics that is useful for some things but not others. So what, exactly, is it?
> 
> This question has always bothered me, but now after thinking about it a lot I finally have a clear answer: rationalism is the belief that [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] is the rightful caliph.
> 
> No! Sorry! I think “the rationalist community” is a tribe much like the Sunni or Shia that started off with some pre-existing differences, found a rallying flag, and then developed a culture.

Other definitions include:[^8^](#fn8)

> ...typical rationalist philosophical positions include reductionism, materialism, moral non-realism, utilitarianism, anti-[deathism](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Deathism) and transhumanism. Rationalists across all three groups tend to have high opinions of the [[Sequences]] and Slate Star Codex and cite both in arguments; rationalist discourse norms were shaped by [[How To Actually Change Your Mind]] and [37 Ways Words Can Be Wrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human's_Guide_to_Words), among others.

And:[^9^](#fn9)

> ...a community that call themselves Rationalists, that read ‘high-IQ sites’ such as [Marginal Revolution](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Marginal_Revolution), Less Wrong, and Slate Star Codex, and according to various surveys, identify as liberal, are atheist or agnostic, and, in general, hold a ‘realist’ philosophical worldview.

## Additional attributes

A crowdsourced list of traits of community:[^10^](#fn10)

*   Seeing the [[Prisoner's Dilemma|Prisoner's dilemma]] and other [[Game Theory|game theory]] applications everywhere
*   Being perpetually vigilant of personal [[Bias|biases]]
*   [Epistemic rationality](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Epistemic_rationality) through constantly aligning one's beliefs as closely as possible with the actual state of the world

## Individualistic vs Organizational

![](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/images/thumb/b/b2/Rationalsphere.png/300px-Rationalsphere.png)

It's a sphere!

[Raemon](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Raemon) argues the rationalist movement could be subdivided into individualistic and organisational views.[^11^](#fn11) [Project Hufflepuff](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Project_Hufflepuff) attempts to strengthen both approaches.

The Rationalsphere

Contains key modes of thinking for the individual including:

*   Truthseeking - biases, empiricism etc
*   Impact - making the world a better place ( e.g. effective altruism, AI safety )
*   Human - becoming a better person

On the other hand:

The Rationality Community

Encompasses the major subscribing organisations ( [CFAR](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/CFAR), [Giving What We Can](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Giving_What_We_Can) etc ) as well as the many [meetup groups](https://www.lesswrong.com/about_meetup_groups) , friends and relationships discovered from participation in the community.

## Rationalist-adjacent

Adjacent ideas include:[^12^](#fn12)

> There are people who agree on few to no rationalist positions but still like going to our parties and reading our blog posts. I coined the term “**rationalist-adjacent**” for this group before I got the idea that the names of all subdivisions of the rationalist community should begin with the letter C...A lot of Less Wrong references a lot of nerd culture, such as catgirls, anime, fanfiction, [[Methods of Rationality (Fanfiction)|Harry Potter]], My Little Pony, etc

*   [[Effective Altruism|Effective altruism]]
*   [Neoreaction movement](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neoreactionary_movement),[^13^](#fn13) \- A notoriously adjacent idea whist being explicitly refuted by figures such as Eliezer[^14^](#fn14)[^15^](#fn15) and Scott,[^16^](#fn16) is often actively related by [[Criticisms of The Rationalist Movement|critics]].[^17^](#fn17)[^18^](#fn18)[^19^](#fn19)
*   [Polyamory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory)[^20^](#fn20)[^21^](#fn21)[^22^](#fn22)
*   The [Facebook](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Facebook) [group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/144017955332/) formally known as 'LessWrong' now 'Brain Debugging Discussion'
*   Wider [[Fiction|rationalist fiction]]

## Skepticism of term

There is a some drive to avoid any 'isms' and instead focus on 'rationality' rather than 'rationalism.[^23^](#fn23)

## Culture

The culture is often defined by its saying such as those featured in [rationalists-out-of-context.tumblr.com](https://rationalists-out-of-context.tumblr.com).
