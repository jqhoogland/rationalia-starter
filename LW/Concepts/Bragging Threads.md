Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to comment on this thread explaining **the most awesome thing you've done this month**. You may be as blatantly proud of yourself as you feel. You may unabashedly consider yourself *the coolest freaking person ever* because of that awesome thing you're dying to tell everyone about. This is the place to do just that.

Remember, however, that this **isn't** any kind of progress thread. Nor is it any kind of proposal thread. *This thread is solely for people to talk about the awesome things they have done. Not "will do". Not "are working on"*. **Have already done.** This is to cultivate an environment of object level productivity rather than meta-productivity methods.

So, what's the coolest thing you've done this month?
