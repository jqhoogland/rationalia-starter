# Utility Functions

A **utility function** assigns numerical values ("utilities") to outcomes, in such a way that outcomes with higher utilities are always [[Preference|preferred]] to outcomes with lower utilities.

*See also:* [[Complexity of Value]], [[Decision Theory]], [[Game Theory]], [[Orthogonality Thesis]], [[Utilitarianism]], [[Preference]], [[Utility]], [[VNM Theorem]]

Utility Functions do not work very well in practice for individual humans. Human drives are not coherent nor is there any reason to think they would be ([Thou Art Godshatter](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/l3/thou_art_godshatter/)), and even people with a strong interest in the concept have trouble working out what their utility function actually is even slightly ([Post Your Utility Function](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/zv/post_your_utility_function/)). Furthermore, humans appear to calculate utility and disutility separately - adding one to the other does not predict their behavior accurately. This makes humans highly exploitable.

[pjeby](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/pjeby) posits humans' difficulty in understanding their own utility functions as the root of [[Akrasia|akrasia]].

However, utility functions can be a useful model for dealing with humans in groups, *e.g.* in economics.

The [[VNM Theorem]] tag is likely to be a strict subtag of the Utility Functions tag, because the VNM theorem establishes when preferences can be represented by a utility function, but a post discussing utility functions may or may not discuss the VNM theorem/axioms.
