# Identity

**Identity** is an individual's conception of themselves (1). We might conceive of this as the set of *I am ___* statements an individual would make about themselves. It seems correct that *identity* can be dangerous for epistemics since the desire to maintain one's identity can interfere with updating correctly or changing actions \[[1](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BXQsZmubkovJ76Ldo/the-actionable-version-of-keep-your-identity-small)\], but at the same time there are potentially useful and safe ways to maintain an identity which even enhances one's rationality \[[1](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uR8c2NPp4bWHQ5u45/strategic-choice-of-identity), [2](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zupr296Zy74wpihXT/use-your-identity-carefully)\].  
  
  
*(1) We might consider cases where an external party imposes an identity on someone, but that case has not been the topic of most discussion of Identity on LessWrong.*
