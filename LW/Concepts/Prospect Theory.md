# Prospect Theory

**Prospect Theory** is an attempt by [Amos Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky) and [Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman) to construct a [[Decision Theory|decision theory]] that describes the actual behavior of humans, rather than idealized [[Rationality|rational]] decision-making.

An agent, in prospect theory:

- is [[Loss Aversion|loss-averse]], and so weighs losses (relative to some reference point) more strongly than gains
- is [risk-averse](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/risk_aversion) with respect to gains, but risk-seeking with respect to losses
- uses probability weighting: small probabilities count more and larger probabilities count less than they would under [[Expected Utility|expected utility]].
