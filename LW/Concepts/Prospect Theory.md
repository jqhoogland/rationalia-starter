Prospect Theory is an attempt by [[Decision Theory|Amos Tversky]] that describes the actual behavior of humans, rather than idealized [[Rationality|rational]] decision-making.

An agent, in prospect theory:

- is 
- [[Loss Aversion|loss-averse]]
- , and so weighs losses (relative to some reference point) more strongly than gains
- is 
- [risk-averse](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/risk_aversion)
-  with respect to gains, but risk-seeking with respect to losses
- uses probability 
- weighting:
-  small probabilities count more and larger probabilities count less than they would under
