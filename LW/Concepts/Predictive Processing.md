# Predictive Processing

(From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding)) **predictive processing** is a theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating a mental model of the environment. The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input. This comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model.
