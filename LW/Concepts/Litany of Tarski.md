# Litany of Tarski

The **Litany of Tarski** is a template to remind oneself that beliefs should stem from reality, from what actually *is*, as opposed to what we *want*, or what would be convenient. For any statement X, the litany takes the form "If X, I desire to believe that X".

Quoting [[The Meditation on Curiosity]]:

> *If the box contains a diamond,*  
> *I desire to believe that the box contains a diamond;*  
> *If the box does not contain a diamond,*  
> *I desire to believe that the box does not contain a diamond;*  
> *Let me not become attached to beliefs I may not want.*

The name refers to [Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski), who sought to define [what, exactly, "truth" means](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/).
