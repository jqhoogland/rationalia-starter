# Making Beliefs Pay Rent

Any [[Belief|belief]] should restrict which experiences to anticipate, to be potentially useful and thereby **pay rent** and earn its keep in your mind, so to speak. If a belief does *not* affect what you anticipate experiencing—if the world would look exactly the same whether the belief is true or whether it is false—then how could you possibly *tell* if it were false? And if there's no circumstance under which you would be able to notice your belief were false, then why do you believe it *now*?
