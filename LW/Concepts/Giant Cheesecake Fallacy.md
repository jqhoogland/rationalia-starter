# Giant Cheesecake Fallacy

> Someone says: “When technology advances far enough we’ll be
able to build minds far surpassing human intelligence. Now, it’s obvious that how large
a cheesecake you can make depends on your intelligence. A superintelligence could build
*enormous* cheesecakes—cheesecakes the size of cities—by golly, the future will be full of
giant cheesecakes!” \[...\] The vision leaps directly from *capability* to *actuality*, without considering the necessary intermediate of *motive*.

> -- E Yudkowsky (2006) Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk
