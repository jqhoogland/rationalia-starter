> Someone says: “When technology advances far enough we’ll be
able to build minds far surpassing human intelligence. Now, it’s obvious that how large
a cheesecake you can make depends on your intelligence. A superintelligence could build
enormous cheesecakes—cheesecakes the size of cities—by golly, the future will be full of
giant cheesecakes!” [...] The vision leaps directly from capability to actuality, without considering the necessary intermediate of motive.
