# Rationality As Martial Art

A metaphor for **rationality as the martial art** of the mind; training brains in the same fashion as muscles.

The metaphor is intended to have complex connotations, rather than being strictly positive. Do modern-day martial arts suffer from being [insufficiently tested in realistic fighting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2i/epistemic_viciousness/), and do attempts at [[Rationality|rationality]] training run into the same problem?
