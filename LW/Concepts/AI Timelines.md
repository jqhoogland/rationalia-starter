# AI Timelines

AI Timelines is the discussion of how long until various major milestones in AI progress are achieved, whether it's the timeline until a human-level AI is developed, the timeline until certain benchmarks are defeated, the timeline until we can simulate a mouse-level intelligence, or something else.

This is to be distinguished from the closely related question of [[AI Takeoff|AI takeoff]] speeds, which is about the dynamics of AI progress after human-level AI is developed (e.g. will it be a single project or the whole economy that sees growth, how fast will that growth be, etc).

## How Much Information Do We Need to Specify at Initialization? [[Nature or nurture]]

1. [[AI Bears]] (The longs - academics esp. in neuroscience) We're going to need to build in a lot of the architectural features.

2. [[AI Bulls]] We can just throw more compute at the problem.
	- [@sutton2019]: Flexible methods have always outperformed handcrafted domain knowledge
	- [[NN scaling laws]]
