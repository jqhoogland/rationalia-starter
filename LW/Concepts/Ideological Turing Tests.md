# Ideological Turing Tests

The **Ideological Turing Test** is an exercise where you try to pretend to hold an opposing ideology convincingly enough that outside observers can't reliably distinguish you from a true believer.

[It was first described by economist Bryan Caplan:](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html)

> Put me and five random liberal social science Ph.D.s in a chat room. Let liberal readers ask questions for an hour, then vote on who isn't really a liberal. Then put \[economist Paul\] Krugman and five random libertarian social science Ph.D.s in a chat room. Let libertarian readers ask questions for an hour, then vote on who isn't really a libertarian. Simple as that.

Passing the ideological Turing test is a sign that you understand the opposing ideology on a deep level.

The ideological Turing test has a similar motivation to [[Steelmanning]], but works in a different way.

The name comes from the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) proposed by computer scientist Alan Turing, where a computer program must pretend to be a human while human judges try to tell it apart from real humans.
