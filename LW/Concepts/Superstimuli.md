# Superstimuli

Humans evolved various desires that promoted survival and reproductive success in the [ancestral environment](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/darwins-subterranean-world/201806/3-things-we-know-about-the-ancestral-environment). **Superstimuli** are modern inventions that satisfy desires better than anything in the ancestral environment could but are detrimental to survival, reproduction, or other high-level goals.

> *A candy bar is a* superstimulus*: it contains more concentrated sugar, salt, and fat than anything that exists in the ancestral environment.   A candy bar matches taste buds that evolved in a hunter-gatherer environment, but it matches those taste buds much more strongly than anything that actually existed in the hunter-gatherer environment. The signal that once reliably correlated to healthy food has been hijacked, blotted out with a point in tastespace that wasn't in the training dataset - an impossibly distant outlier on the old ancestral graphs. *
