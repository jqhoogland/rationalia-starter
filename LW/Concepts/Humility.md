Outside of LessWrong, "humility" usually [refers to](https://www.google.com/search?q=humility) "a modest or low view of one's own importance". In common parlance, to be [humble](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=%20HUMBLE) is to be meek, deferential, submissive, or unpretentious, "not arrogant or prideful". Thus, in ordinary English "humility" and "[modesty](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/modesty)" have pretty similar connotations.

On LessWrong, Eliezer Yudkowsky has proposed that we instead draw a sharp distinction between two kinds of "humility" — social modesty, versus "scientific humility".

In [The Proper Use of Humility](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GrDqnMjhqoxiqpQPw/the-proper-use-of-humility) (2006), Yudkowsky writes:…

# False Humility

- **Humility ≠ Social modesty**. Don't be the modesty-[[Signaling|signaler]]. Or an adherent to zesjescultuur. [[Environment of evolutionary adaptedness#^2ffad4]]
- Don't be the creationist who offers a feigned humility in "evolution is just a theory"
- The [[Relativism|relativist]] who argues that 2 + 2 can equal 5 (maybe they go so far as to throw in the problem of induction).
- Watch out with [[Disconfirmation bias]]

# Arrogance

- [[Physics]] needs a little arrogance to build better models (if we expect our models to be perfect)
- [[Science]] shouldn't compromise on questions like [[Evolution]] and Flat-Earth
