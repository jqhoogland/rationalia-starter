Inductive bias refers to your suspicion that if the sun has risen for the last billion days in a row, then it may rise tomorrow as well. Since it is [logically possible](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/logically_possible) that the laws of physics will arbitrarily cease to work and that the sun will *not* rise tomorrow, coming to this conclusion requires an inductively biased [prior](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/prior).

This sort of bias is not a bad thing - without "inductive bias" you can't draw any conclusion at all from the data. It's just a different technical meaning attached to the same word.
