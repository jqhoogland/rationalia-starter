# Techniques for Probability Estimates
- **Prepare for Revelation**: What would you expect if you expect the answer to shortly be revealed. See [[Belief in Belief]].
- **Bet on it**.
	- Note: this only works when utility is linear in winnings
- **Convert to a Frequency** (Sun rising tomorrow)
	- Watch out with atypical & time-varying cases.
- **Find a Reference Class** (Big Foot?)
- **Make Multiple Statements** (France > Italy in area?)
- **Imagine Hypothetical Evidence** (God exists on million sided die)
