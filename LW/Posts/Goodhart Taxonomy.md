# Four mechanisms

$V$ as the true goal; $U$ as the proxy.

1. **Regressional**: When you select not only for the true goal, but also the difference between the proxy and the goal. It is likely the case that when $U = V + X, \max U > \max V$ because $X$ is also large.
2. **Causal**: If $V$ causes $U$, then increasing $U$ need not increase $V$. (Can also involve an external factor)
3. **Extremal**: Worlds in which $U$ is extremal may be very different from ordinary worlds where $U$ is correlated with $V$.
4. **Adversarial**: When you optimize for a proxy, you incentivize adversaries to correlate their goals with your proxy.
