# But There's Still A Chance, Right?
> Years ago, I was speaking to someone when he casually remarked that he didn’t believe in evolution. And I said, “This is not the nineteenth century. When Darwin first proposed evolution, it might have been reasonable to doubt it. But this is the twenty-first century. We can _read the genes._ Humans and chimpanzees have 98% shared DNA. We _know_ humans and chimps are related. It’s _over._”
>
> He said, “Maybe the DNA is just similar by coincidence.”
>
> I said, “The odds of that are something like two to the power of seven hundred and fifty million to one.”

> He said, “But there’s still a chance, right?”


> We can use words to describe numbers that small, but not feelings—a feeling that small doesn’t exist, doesn’t fire enough neurons or release enough neurotransmitters to be felt.
