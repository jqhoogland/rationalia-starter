# The Pyramid And The Garden

The Pyramid of Giza's latitude matches the speed of light in m/s up to 9 sig figs (alright â€” 6 if you account for the fact that all three of the last digits match the pyramid's location).

Even then, it's a 1 in a million chance! Well, when you have so many variables to choose from (longitude or latitude, choice of units, distance from equator, Pyramid vs. Sphinx, etc.), it's not really a 1 in a million chance, is it?

So too, worry about $p < 0.05$ as "statistically significant" doesn't always have to mean "statistically significant".
