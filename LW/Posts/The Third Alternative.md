# The Third Alternative
Believing in Santa as a Noble Lie (as a source of wonder and promoter of good behavior) presents a false dilemma. 

There are other sources of wonder & promoters of good behavior without the compromise.

The hard part about finding Third Alternatives is:
1. Deciding to look for one
2. Deciding to act on it.

Actually finding one once resolved to do so isn't so bad.

> _If I saw that there was a superior alternative to my current policy, would I be glad in the depths of my heart, or would I feel a tiny flash of reluctance before I let go?_ If the answers are “no” and “yes,” beware that you may not have searched for a Third Alternative.

Actually spend the 5 minutes looking for options.
