Tricks to get p > 0.05 (via [False Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility In Data Collection And Analysis Allows Presenting Anything As Significant](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611417632)): 
1. **Measure multiple dependent variables & report the significant ones.**
2. **Artificially choose when to end a study**
3. **Control for "cofounders"**. Split into subgroups & one subgroup will exhibit significance by chance.
4. **Test different conditions & report the ones you like.**

> a broader meta-point is that on important studies scientists should have to submit their experimental protocol to a journal and get it accepted or rejected in advance so they can't change tactics mid-stream or drop data.

E.g.: how do (for-profit) private rehab programs get to claim 60%+ success rates?
