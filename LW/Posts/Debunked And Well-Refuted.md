E.g.: The Federalist arguing against the 1/5 campus rape statistic.

This is not about radical skepticism. Some studies are "super-debunked".

E.g.: Vaccines cause autism. From the British Medical Journal: 
> Clear evidence of falsification of data should now close the door on this damaging vaccine scare … Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children’s cases accurately? No.

**The problem**
> But “debunked” and “refuted” aren’t saying you disagree with a study. They’re making arguments from authority. They’re saying “the authority of the scientific community has come together and said this is a piece of crap that doesn’t count”.
