# Eight Short Studies On Excuses

- **Clumsy Game-Player**
- **Lazy Student**
- **Grieving Student**
- **Sports fan**
- **Murderous Husband** %% There may be situations where no precommitment is enough. %%
- **Bellicose dictator**
- **Peyote-popping Native**
- **Well-disguised Atheist**

> The general principle is that by accepting an excuse, a rule-maker is also committing themselves to accepting all equally good excuses in the future

JGWeissman suggests extrapolating precommitments, i.e., precommiting to acting like you made all the precommitments you will wish you have made retroactively.
