# Failing to Learn From History
> We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and it seems to us that these matters have _always been_ the proper realm of science, that they have _never been_ mysterious. When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain something that _feels_ mysterious to them. Science is only good for explaining _scientific_ subjects, like stars and matter and life
