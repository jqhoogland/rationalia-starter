# What's a Bias?
![[Cognitive bias#^f75004]]

These are faults induced by our own mental machinery â€” not some outside factor like limited compute, cost of information, etc. (errors from cognitive content).

Biases are not intrinsically evil. We try to overcome them because they are obstacles in our way of obtaining truth.
