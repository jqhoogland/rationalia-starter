# Making History Available
> Don’t you remember how many times your biases have killed you? You don’t? I’ve noticed that sudden amnesia often follows a fatal mistake. But take it from me, it happened. I remember; I wasn’t there.

> So the next time you doubt the strangeness of the future, remember how you were born in a hunter-gatherer tribe ten thousand years ago, when no one knew of Science at all. Remember how you were shocked, to the depths of your being, when Science explained the great and terrible sacred mysteries that you once revered so highly. Remember how you once believed that you could fly by eating the right mushrooms, and then you accepted with disappointment that you would never fly, and then you flew. Remember how you had always thought that slavery was right and proper, and then you changed your mind. [Don’t imagine how you](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/) _could_ have predicted the change, for that is amnesia. _Remember_ that, in fact, you did not guess. Remember how, century after century, the world changed in ways you did not guess.

> Maybe then you will be less shocked by what happens next.
