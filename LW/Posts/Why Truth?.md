# Why Truth?

**Several views**
- **Moral**: Pursuing truth is inherently noble, important, and worthwhile.
- **Instrumental**: Truth has an instrumental value in and of itself. 
- **Curiosity**: "you might care about whats true because, damn it, you'reÂ _[[Curiosity|curious]]_."

For Yudkowsky, [[curiosity]] is most foundational. It is more "pure" as a motivation than the instrumental view, and it leads to less tribal failure modes than the moral view.
