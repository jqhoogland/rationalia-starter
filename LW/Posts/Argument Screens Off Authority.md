# Argument Screens Off Authority
> A good technical argument is one that _eliminates_ reliance on the personal authority of the speaker.

E.g.:
- Geologist & non-geologist making counterintuitive claims both with good argumentation.
- Two equal authorities making counterintuitive claims with good & bad argumentation, respectively.
- In the first two, the need for authority vanishes. In the second two, the quality of argumentation triumphs.

$$P(\text{truth}|\text{argument},\text{expert}) = P(\text{truth}|\text{argument})$$

> In practice you can never _completely_ eliminate reliance on authority. Good authorities are more likely to know about any counterevidence that exists and should be taken into account; a lesser authority is less likely to know this, which makes their arguments less reliable. This is not a factor you can eliminate merely by hearing the evidence they _did_ take into account.
