# Religion's Claim to Be Non-Disprovable
> Back in the old days, people actually _believed_ their religions instead of just _believing in_ them.

> The orthogonality of religion and factual questions is a _recent_ and strictly _Western_ concept. The people who wrote the original scriptures didn’t even know the difference.

> The modern concept of religion as purely _ethical_ derives from every other area’s having been taken over by better institutions. Ethics is what’s _left_.
>
> Or rather, people _think_ ethics is what’s left.

> The idea that religion is a separate magisterium that _cannot be proven or disproven_ is a Big Lie—a lie which is repeated over and over again, so that people will say it without thinking; yet which is, on critical examination, simply false.
