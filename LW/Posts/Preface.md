# Preface

Two mistakes:
1. Intention was solving big, important problems— not improving everyday lives.
2. The problem is figuring out how to *put "rationality" in practice*— not learn it in theory.
3. To much focus on rational belief— not enough on rational *action*.
4. Not enough organization. %% Seems to be largely corrected %%
5. Too discourteous about bad ideas. %% Though Yudkowsky did avoid [[Bulverism]] %%

[[Rationality]]

> There is a certain valuable way of thinking, which is not yet taught in schools, in this present day. This certain way of thinking is not taught systematically at all. It is just absorbed by people who grow up reading books like _Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman_ or who have an unusually great teacher in high school.
> 
> Most famously, this certain way of thinking has to do with science, and with the experimental method. The part of science where you go out and look at the universe instead of just making things up. The part where you say “Oops” and give up on a bad theory when the experiments don’t support it.
>
> But this certain way of thinking extends beyond that. It is deeper and more universal than a pair of goggles you put on when you enter a laboratory and take off when you leave. It applies to daily life, though this part is subtler and more difficult. But if you can’t say “Oops” and give up when it looks like something isn’t working, you have no choice but to keep shooting yourself in the foot. You have to keep reloading the shotgun and you have to keep pulling the trigger. You know people like this. And somewhere, someplace in your life you’d rather not think about, you _are_ people like this. It would be nice if there was a certain way of thinking that could help us stop doing that.
