# Burdensome Details

[[Conjunction Fallacy]]
- Adding detail can make a scenario sound more plausible, even though the event necessarily becomes less probable.

This is because we [“substitute judgment of representativeness for judgment of probability.”](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jj/conjunction_controversy_or_how_they_nail_it_down).

E.g.:
- USSR invades Poland and USSR stops diplomatic relations with US rated as more likely than USSR stops diplomatic relations with US.

## How to remedy?
- > They would need to be wary of [the word, "and"]—not just wary, but leap back from it. . . . And they would need to penalize the probability _substantially_—a factor of four, at least, according to the experimental details.
- When presented with the single case, imagine concrete scenarios.
- Increase the emotional salience of [[Occam's Razor]]
