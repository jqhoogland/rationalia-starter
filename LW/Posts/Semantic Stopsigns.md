# Semantic Stopsigns
Consider the paradox of the First Cause.

Many resolve with the semantic stopsign "God!" — a signal to not think past this point.

Other examples include:
- "Liberal Democracy" when the question is any thorny transhumanist policy issue
- "Corporations"

> No word is a stopsign of itself; the question is whether a word has that effect on a particular person. Having strong emotions about something doesn’t qualify it as a stopsign. ... What distinguishes a semantic stopsign is _failure to consider the obvious next question_.
