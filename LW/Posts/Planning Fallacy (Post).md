# Planning Fallacy

We make predictions based on ideal "best case" scenarios rather than realistic "typical" case scenarios. 

E.g.:
| What | Late | $ Overrun (Total) | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Denver International Airport | 16 months | $2 billion | 
| Eurofighter Typhoon | 54 months | $12 billion ($19 billion) |
| Sydney Opera House | 10 years | $95 million ($102 million) |

Buehler et al. (1995): Student predictions of completion time
| Prediction | % of students actually achieved |
| ----- | ------ |
| 50% | 13% | 
| 75% | 19% |
| 99% |  45% |

## How to remedy?
Use [[Inside, Outside View|outside view rather than inside view]]. Make your prediction based on how long similar things took in the past.

Even better: ask an experienced outsider.
