# Lawful Uncertainty
Example of guessing red & blue cards where the frequency is 30%/70%. The optimal strategy is to guess always blue, where participants end up guessing the more common item with slightly higher than base rate.

The experimenter, Dawes posits: “Despite feedback through a thousand trials, subjects cannot bring themselves to believe that the situation is one in which they _cannot_ predict.”

> I would suspect that something simpler is going on—that the all-blue strategy _just didn’t occur_ to the subjects.

> It is a _counterintuitive_ idea that the optimal strategy can be to _think lawfully, even under conditions of uncertainty_.
