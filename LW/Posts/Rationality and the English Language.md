# Rationality and the English Language
> Nonfiction conveys _knowledge_, fiction conveys _experience._ Medical science can extrapolate what would happen to a human unprotected in a vacuum. Fiction can make you live through it.

> Authors, on the other hand, are trained _not_ to give themselves the benefit of the doubt. Whatever the audience _thinks_ you said _is_ what you said, whether you meant to say it or not; you can’t argue with the audience no matter how clever your justifications.

> What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around. In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them. When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then, if you want to describe the thing you have been visualising you probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning. Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and get one’s meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations. 

— George Orwell
