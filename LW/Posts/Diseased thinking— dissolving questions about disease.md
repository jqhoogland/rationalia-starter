# Diseased Thinking: Dissolving Questions About Disease

Are conditions like obesity, alcoholism, etc. "*disease*"?

Well, what is "*disease*"?

1. Something caused by biology subjects like bacteria, viruses, genes, biology?
2. Something involuntary and immune to [[Free Will]]
3. Something rare.
4. Something unpleasant.
5. Something discrete.
6. Something treated by "science-y interventions like chemicals and radiation."

What is not a disease?

- Dwarfism fails (5), aging (3), homosexuality (4), obesity (2, 3, 5)

Remember, [[Disguised Queries|words often force categories on the uncategorizable]]. That is, stop caring about the word "disease".

Scott identifies two types of explanation
- **Deontologist libertarian** (as in [[Free Will|"free will"]]): Good decisions reflect goodness. Bad decisions reflect badness or the influence of uncontrollable factors like brain tumors.
- **Determinist consequentialist**: It's biology (chemistry, & physics) all the way down. But some behaviors are more socially influenceable. Punishment is only valuable as a deterrence mechanism, not part of some moral compensation.

[[Reversal Test]] is an easy counter to those who complain "that the existence of an easy medical solution prevents people from learning personal responsibility."

Quoting [Katja Grace](http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2009/09/21/why-do-animal-lovers-want-animals-to-feel-pain/): 
> _...the situation reminds me of a pattern in similar cases I have noticed before. It goes like this. Some people make personal sacrifices, supposedly toward solving problems that don’t threaten them personally. They sort recycling, buy free range eggs, buy fair trade, campaign for wealth redistribution etc. Their actions are seen as virtuous. They see those who don’t join them as uncaring and immoral. A more efficient solution to the problem is suggested. It does not require personal sacrifice. People who have not previously sacrificed support it. Those who have previously sacrificed object on grounds that it is an excuse for people to get out of making the sacrifice. The supposed instrumental action, as the visible sign of caring, has become virtuous in its own right. Solving the problem effectively is an attack on the moral people._
