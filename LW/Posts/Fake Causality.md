# Fake Causality

E.g.: You're a soldier standing in line. How to count the number of soldiers? Dynamic programming: "How many soldiers in front of you?" to the soldier in front of you. "How many behind you" to the soldier behind you. Each soldier has to track the forward & backward messages individually.

The same kind of algorithm holds in Bayes net so you avoid double-counting evidence.
