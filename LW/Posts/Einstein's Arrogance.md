# Einstein's Arrogance
> A journalist asked Einstein what he would do if Eddington’s observations failed to match his theory. Einstein famously replied: “Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord. The theory is correct.”
>
> It seems like a rather foolhardy statement, defying the trope of Traditional Rationality that experiment above all is sovereign. Einstein seems possessed of an arrogance so great that he would refuse to bend his neck and submit to Nature’s answer, as scientists must do. Who can _know_ that the theory is correct, in advance of experimental test?
>
> Of course, Einstein did turn out to be right.

> Just _finding_ the right answer, within a large space of possibilities, requires a large amount of evidence.

With 100 million options, you need 27 bits of evidence just to focus your attention on the right option.

> _At the time of first formulating the hypothesis_—the very first time the equations popped into his head—Einstein must have had, _already in his possession,_ sufficient observational evidence to single out the complex equations of General Relativity for his unique attention. Or he couldn’t have gotten them _right._
