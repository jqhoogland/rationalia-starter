# Availability
>  judging the frequency or probability of an event by the ease with which examples of the event come to mind.

- E.g.: Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs 1978 "Judged Frequency of Lethal Events"
| Subject Opinion | True |
| --- | --- |
| Accidents ~ Disease | Diseases = 16x |
| Homicide > Suicide | Suicide = 2x |

In the worst case, we get [[Absurdity Heuristic|absurdity bias]]: to events that have not yet happened we assign probability zero.

- E.g.: Burtoni et al. 1978:  
> While building dams decreases the _frequency_ of floods, damage _per flood_ is afterward so much greater that average yearly damage _increases_.
