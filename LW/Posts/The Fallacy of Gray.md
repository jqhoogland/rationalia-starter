# The Fallacy of Gray
> The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”
> 
> The Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view . . .”
—Marc Stiegler, _David’s Sling_

From Iain M. Banks:
> **every society imposes some of its values on those raised within it, but the point is that some societies try to maximize that effect, and some try to minimize it**.

On the critique that no one can "eliminate bias":
> That which I cannot _eliminate_ may be well worth _reducing_.

Cf.
> “Every scientific paradigm imposes some of its assumptions on how it interprets experiments,” and then act like they’d proven science to occupy the same level with witchdoctoring.

Asimov’s “The Relativity of Wrong”:

> When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.
