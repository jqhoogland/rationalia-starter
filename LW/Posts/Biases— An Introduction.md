# Biases: An Introduction

**Statistical bias**: when your sample is unrepresentative of the population. Acquiring more data can make your predictions *worse*.

**Cognitive bias**: a systematic error in how we think. (i.e., non-random, not caused by ignorance)

**Examples**:
- [[Optimism bias]]
- [[Base rate fallacy]]
- [[Sunk-Cost Fallacy]]

We have a "bias blind spot" with regard to our own flaws. 

**Goal** (of this book): 

> to lay the groundwork for creating rationality “expertise.”

Where "**expertise**" is “the development of a schematic principle that involves conceptual understanding of the problem”
