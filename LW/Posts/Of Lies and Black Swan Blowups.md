# Of Lies and Black Swan Blowups
> Judge Marcus Einfeld, age 70, Queen’s Counsel since 1977, Australian Living Treasure 1997, United Nations Peace Award 2002, founding president of Australia’s Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, retired a few years back but routinely brought back to judge important cases . . .
> 
> . . . went to jail for two years over a series of perjuries and lies [that started with a $77, 6-mph-over speeding ticket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Einfeld).
> 
> That whole _suspiciously virtuous-sounding_ theory about honest people not being good at lying, and entangled traces being left somewhere, and the entire thing blowing up in a Black Swan epic fail, actually _does_ have a certain number of exemplars in real life, though obvious selective reporting is at work in our hearing about this one.
