# Pretending to Be Wise
> The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.
  —~~Dante Alighieri, famous hell expert~~
  —John F. Kennedy, [misquoter](http://www.bartleby.com/73/1211.html)


> [I]t is possible to make _under_ confident assertions relative to ones anticipations. One can wear the attire of uncertainty, or profess an agnosticism that isn’t really there. Here, I'll single out a special case of improper uncertainty: the display of _neutrality_ or _suspended judgment_ in order to signal maturity, impartiality, or a superior vantage point.

E.g.: A principal or Great Power telling students or smaller nations that it doesn't matter "who started it."

> “Washing one’s hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral.” — Paolo Freire

> "The error here is similar to one I see all the time in beginning philosophy students: when confronted with reasons to be skeptics, they instead become relativists. That is, when the rational conclusion is to suspend judgment about an issue, all too many people instead conclude that any judgment is as plausible as any other." — Michael Rooney
