# What is Evidence?
> The sentence “snow is white” is _true_ if and only if snow is white.
> 
> —Alfred Tarski

> To say of what is, that it is, or of what is not, that it is not, is _true_.
> 
> —Aristotle, _Metaphysics IV_

> What is _evidence?_ It is an event entangled, by links of cause and effect, with whatever you want to know about.

Entangled in the sense of Shannon mutual information, not quantum.

> If your eyes and brain work correctly, your beliefs will end up entangled with the facts. _Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence._

Beliefs *should* be contagious (among rational, honest folk).
