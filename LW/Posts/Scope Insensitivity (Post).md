# Scope Insensitivity

> The usual finding is that _exponential_ increases in scope create _linear_ increases in willingness-to-pay—perhaps corresponding to the linear time for our eyes to glaze over the zeroes

## Why?
1. **Valuation by prototype**
	- The hypothesis that we estimate our willingness-to-pay by conjuring up a single emotionally laden example ("the prototype").
2. **Purchase of moral satisfaction**
	- We spend to create [[fuzzies|warm glow]]. This has little to do with the scope.

See [[Weber's Law]]
