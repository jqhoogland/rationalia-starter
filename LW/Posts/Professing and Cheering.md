# Professing and Cheering
Yudkowsky was once in a panel on "the topic, “Are science and religion compatible?” One of the women on the panel, a pagan, held forth interminably upon how she believed that the Earth had been created when a giant primordial cow was born into the primordial abyss."

This wasn't just vanilla [[Belief in belief]]. It's "cheering" for paganism. No one is convincing anyone, just cheering their identity.
