# Applause Lights
> I think it means that you have said the word “democracy,” so the audience is supposed to cheer. It’s not so much a propositional statement or belief, as the equivalent of the “Applause” light that tells a studio audience when to clap.

## How to identify?
If reversing the statement sounds abnormal, the unreversed statement probably doesn't convey any new information. 

This can still be valuable (e.g., as introduction to a discussion topic), but if no specifics follow, it is probably an applause light.

E.g.:

> We need to balance the risks and opportunities of AI.

and

> We shouldn’t balance the risks and opportunities of AI.
