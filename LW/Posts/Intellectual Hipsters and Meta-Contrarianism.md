# Intellectual Hipsters and Meta-Contrarianism

Many debates fall into a triad of **uneducated, contrarian, and meta-contrarian**. E.g.:
- Death is bad (5-year-old) / Death has benefits (most people) / Death is bad (rationalists)
- Conservatism / Liberalism / Libertarianism
- KKK-style racist / PC liberal / "but there are scientifically proven differences"
- Alternative medicine / Conventional medicine / Robin Hanson

> _the fact that those beliefs are in an order does not mean some of them are good and others are bad_
