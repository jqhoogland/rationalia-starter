# The Proper Use of Humility
Our default association to "humility" is "social modesty," which "has to do with regulating status in the tribe, rather than scientific process."

The aim is "scientific humility," which is a more recent and not inherently social invention.

> But because physicists have this arrogant idea that their models should work _all_ the time, not just _most_ of the time, they follow up on small flaws.

> But think of the social audacity of trying to be right _all_ the time!
