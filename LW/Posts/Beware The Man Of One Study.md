Aquinas: beware the man of one book.
Alexander: beware the man of one study.

This is as a result of normal experimental variation, but also poor experimental design

- E.g.: drugs that have different effects on each subvariety of bipolar disorder will show the full range of possible results when studied over bipolar disorder.

The problem exists even in the meta-analyses.

- E.g.: Krueger and Card study found no evidence for "high minimum wages hurt the economy". One meta-analysis found negative results are publication bias. Another finds consistent effects. Etc. 500 economists signed a letter against the minimum wage. Another 600 signed a letter for it.

Maybe just normal variation? With a slight-negative skew?

**Takeaways**
- "Decrease your confidence about most things if you’re not sure that you’ve investigated every piece of evidence."
- "Do not trust websites which are obviously biased" ... even if the evidence seems very stately indeed. 
- "even if someone gives you what seems like overwhelming evidence in favor of a certain point of view, don’t trust it until you’ve done a simple Google search to see if the opposite side has equally overwhelming evidence."
