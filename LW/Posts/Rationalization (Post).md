# Rationalization

> “Rationalization.” What a curious term. I would call it a _wrong word._ You cannot “rationalize” what is not already rational. It is as if “lying” were called “truthization.”

> "Rationality" is the *forward* flow that gathers evidence, weights it, and outputs a conclusion

> "Rationalization" is a *backward* flow from conclusion to selected evidence
