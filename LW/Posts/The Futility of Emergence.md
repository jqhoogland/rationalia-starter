# The Futility of Emergence
"[[Emergent Behavior|Emergence]]" as a [[Semantic Stopsign]].

> The phrase “emerges from” is acceptable, just like “arises from” or “is caused by” are acceptable, if the phrase precedes some specific model to be judged on its own merits.

> However, this is _not_ the way “emergence” is commonly used. “Emergence” is commonly used as an explanation in its own right.
