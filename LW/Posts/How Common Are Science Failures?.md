> our prior on climate change should be _based upon_ how frequently entire scientific fields get things terribly wrong for political or conformity-related reasons.

When does a scientific mistake count as evidence against climate change:
- It is recent. (E.g.: Aristotelian bile belongs to a less rigorous science)
- It was part of an important, fundamental theory. 
- It was a stubborn resistance to truth. 
- We are now sure the establishment was wrong.

Examples:
- [[Lysenkoism]]: the Soviet theory of agriculture. But this was the USSR.
- Freudian psychoanalysis.
- Behaviorist psychology.
	- Weak version: psychology shouldn't study thoughts and emotions.
	- Strong version: thoughts and emotions don't exist but are post-hoc rationalizations.

Alexander posits $O(10^{1.5})$ such paradigms in the past century for a failure rate of $\sim 1\%$.

%% I think a more conservative baseline would be $O(10^{10})$ fields and 5-10 major failures, for a failure rate of $5-10\%$
%%
