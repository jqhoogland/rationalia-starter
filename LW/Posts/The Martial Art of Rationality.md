# The Martial Art of Rationality

- You don't need bulk to learn martial arts. You don't need braininess to learn rationality (though it can help).

Then why don't we have rationality dojos?
- Verifying the skill is much harder.
- Teaching the skill is much harder.

It's also because our knowledge of rationality is *new*:
- [[Heuristics & Biases]] program in psychology
- [[Bayesianism|Bayesian systematization]] of probability theory and statistics
- [[Evolutionary psychology]] & Social psychology
- etc.

Yudkowsky's understanding was acquiring in "wrestling with the challenge of [[artificial general intelligence]] (an endeavor which, to actually succeed, would require sufficient mastery of rationality to build a complete working rationalist out of toothpicks and rubber bands)."  %% From everything we can see with modern ML techniques, AGI won't require a mastery of rationality. %%
