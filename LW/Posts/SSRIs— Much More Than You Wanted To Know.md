**Claims**
**1. Antidepressants were oversold and painted as having more biochemical backing than was really justified** – _Totally true_
**2. Modern SSRI antidepressants are no better than older tricyclic and MAOI antidepressants, but are prescribed much more because of said overselling** – _First part true, second part less so_ %% Caveat: it's hard to pinpoint smaller differences. A major reason seems to be that SSRIs have less suicide-enabling side-effects. %%
**3. There is large publication bias in the antidepressant literature** – _True, but not as important as some people think_
**4. The effect size of antidepressants is clinically insignificant** – _Depends what you mean by “clinically insignificant”_ %% this is not  the same as "statistically insignificant" %%
- Suppose antidepressants were in fact a weight loss pill.
	- An effect size of 1.2 is equivalent to the pill making you lose 32 lb.
	- An effect size of 0.5 is equivalent to the pill making you lose 14 lb.
	- An effect size of 0.3 is equivalent to the pill making you lose 8.5 lb.
**5. The effect of antidepressants only becomes significant in the most severe depression** – _Everything about this statement is terrible and everyone involved should feel_  %% WTF is "severe"; Episodes > Symptoms %%
**6. The beneficial effects of antidepressants are only noticed by doctors, not the patients themselves** – _Partly true but okay_
**7. The apparent benefits of antidepressant over placebo may be an “active placebo” effect rather than a drug effect** – _Unlikely_
**8. Antidepressants have much worse side effects than you were led to believe** – _Depends how bad you were led to believe the side effects were_
>  there are three side effects of SSRIs that I consider especially worrisome and worthy of further discussion. These are weight gain, sexual side effects, and emotional blunting.

But...
- > When you go from not eating to eating, you gain weight.
- Certain SSRIs may in a small subset of cases cause *permanent* sexual dysfunction.
- Barnhart et al.: “this adverse effect has been noted to be dose-dependent and reversible”
**9. Therefore, we should give up on medication and use psychotherapy instead** – _Makes sense right up until you run placebo-controlled trials of psychotherapy_
**10. Further complications**
