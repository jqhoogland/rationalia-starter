# Absolute Authority
> In the world of the unenlightened ones, there is authority and un-authority.... If scientists have changed their stories ever in their history, then science cannot be a true Authority, and can never again be trusted.

How to counter this in front of an audience?

>  “The power of science comes from having the ability to change our minds and admit we’re wrong. If you’ve never admitted you’re wrong, it doesn’t mean you’ve made fewer mistakes.”

"Not absolutely certain" is an instance of intellectual humility. Science's notion of "certainty" has higher standards than "certainty" in other domains.

How to counter this in private?
1. It is possible to live without certainty.

> A probability of 1.0 isn’t just certainty, it’s _infinite certainty_.
