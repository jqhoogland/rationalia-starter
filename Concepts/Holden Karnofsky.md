Holden Karnofsky is a co-founder of [effective altruism](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/effective-altruism) pioneers [GiveWell](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/givewell).

In May 2012, Karnofsky posted [Thoughts on the Singularity Institute (SI)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si/), which became the most-upvoted article ever on Less Wrong. It offered a detailed critique of what is now the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/machine-intelligence-research-institute-miri), and spawned a great deal of discussion.

MIRI staff posted two replies:

- [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/eliezer-yudkowsky)
- , 
- [Reply to Holden on 'Tool AI'](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cze/reply_to_holden_on_tool_ai/)

- [Reply to Holden on The Singularity Institute](http://lesswrong.com/lw/di4/reply_to_holden_on_the_singularity_institute/)

- [Objection 2: SI appears to neglect the potentially important distinction between "tool" and "agent" AI.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ccl/holden_karnofskys_singularity_institute_objection/)
- [Objection 3: SI's envisioned scenario is far more specific and conjunctive than it appears at first glance, and I believe this scenario to be highly unlikely.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ccm/holden_karnofskys_singularity_institute_objection/)
- [Is SI the kind of organization we want to bet on?](http://lesswrong.com/lw/cco/holden_karnofskys_singularity_institute_critique/)
