[Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com) is a group blog on the systemic mistakes humans make, and how we can possibly correct them. The primary contributors are [[Robin Hanson]] of George Mason University and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [MIRI|Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/machine-intelligence-research-institute-miri). Common topics include "cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, microeconomics, applied statistics, social psychology, probability and decision theory, even a bit of Artificial Intelligence now and then."

The complete list of Yudkowsky's posts on Overcoming Bias was compiled by Andrew Hay [here](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~andwhay/postlist.html).

A categorized list of Yudkowsky's posts moved from Overcoming Bias to Less Wrong is available at [Less Wrong/All Articles](https://www.lesswrong.com/about/All_Articles).
