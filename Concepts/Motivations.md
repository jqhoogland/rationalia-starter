# Motivations
Motivations are the reasons why we think and do the things that we do. Related: Desire, Values. Many questions can asked about motivation such as: i) what does/could/should motivate people? ii) which stated motivations are true motivations for belief and behavior? iii) which motivations are *valid* vs *invalid*? iv) How does motivation even work?
