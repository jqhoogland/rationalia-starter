# Impact Measures
Impact measures penalize an AI for affecting us too much. To reduce the risk posed by a powerful AI, you might want to make it try accomplish its goals with as little impact on the world as possible. You reward the AI for crossing a room; to maximize time-discounted total reward, the optimal policy makes a huge mess as it sprints to the other side.How do you rigorously define "low impact" in a way that a computer can understand – how do you measure impact? These questions are important for both prosaic and future AI systems: objective specification [is](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EbFABnst8LsidYs5Y/goodhart-taxonomy) [hard](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7b2RJJQ76hjZwarnj/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity); we don't want AI systems to rampantly disrupt their environment. In the limit of goal-directed intelligence, [theorems suggest that seeking power tends to be optimal](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6DuJxY8X45Sco4bS2/seeking-power-is-often-provably-instrumentally-convergent-in); we don't want highly capable AI systems to permanently wrench control of the future from us. 

Currently, impact measurement research focuses on two approaches:
