Free will is one of the *easiest* hard questions, as millennia-old philosophical dilemmas go. Though this [impossible question](http://lesswrong.com/lw/og/wrong_questions/) is generally considered [fully and completely dissolved](http://lesswrong.com/lw/of/dissolving_the_question/) on Less Wrong, aspiring reductionists should try to solve it on their own.

## Non-spoiler posts
The following posts can be read to set up the problem of "free will" and what constitutes a good solution from a reductionist perspective, without entirely giving away the solution. (When Yudkowsky wrote these posts, he thought he could get away with just leaving it as a practice problem, and some of the posts state that the problem will be left open. However Yudkowsky did eventually find that he needed to write out the whole solution.)
