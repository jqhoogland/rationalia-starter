The conjunction rule of probability theory states that a conjunction (A and B) is necessarily less probable than one of the conjuncts alone (A). Adding more details to a theory may make it sound more plausible to human ears because of the [representativeness heuristic](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/representativeness-heuristic), even as the story becomes normatively less probable, as burdensome details drive the probability of the conjunction down (this is known as [conjunction fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/conjunction-fallacy)). Any detail you add has to be pinned down by a sufficient amount of evidence; all the details you make no claim about can be summed over.
