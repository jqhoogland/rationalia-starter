# Aesthetics
Aesthetics: "Imagine if we could talk about why things seem beautiful and appealing, or ugly and unappealing.  Where do these preferences come from, in a causal sense? Do we still endorse them when we know their origins?  What happens when we bring tacit things into consciousness, when we talk carefully about what aesthetics evoke in us, and how that might be the same or different from person to person?"  – [Naming the Nameless, Sarah Constantin](/posts/4ZwGqkMTyAvANYEDw/naming-the-nameless)
