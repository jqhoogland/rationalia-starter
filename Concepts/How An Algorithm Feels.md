Our philosophical intuitions do not rain down on us as manna from heaven; they are generated by algorithms in the human brain. Our philosophical intuitions, indeed, are how these particular cognitive algorithms feel from the inside.

To dissolve a philosophical dilemma, it often suffices to understand the cognitive algorithm that generates the appearance of the dilemma - if you understand the algorithm in *sufficient detail*. It is not enough to say "An algorithm does it!" - this [might as well be magic](http://lesswrong.com/lw/op/fake_reductionism/). It takes a detailed step-by-step walkthrough.

Michael Vassar has observed that conventional philosophers seem to be *spectacularly* bad at understanding that their intuitions are generated by cognitive algorithms. This may be why works of serious reductionism get written by Artificial Intelligence people instead of conventional philosophers.
