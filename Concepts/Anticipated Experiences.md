# Anticipated Experiences
One principle of rationality is that "[beliefs should pay rent in anticipated experiences](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/a7n8GdKiAZRX86T5A)." If you believe in something, what do you expect to be different as a result? What does the belief say should happen, and what does it say should not happen? If you have a verbal disagreement with someone, how does your disagreement cash out in differing expectations?

If two people try to get specific about the anticipated experiences driving their disagreement, one method for doing so is the [double crux](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement) technique. The notion that beliefs are models of what we expect to experience is also one of the basic premises of [predictive processing](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/predictive-processing) theories of how the brain works. Beliefs that do not pay rent may be related to [meaningless arguments](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4xKeNKFXFB458f5N8/ethnic-tension-and-meaningless-arguments) driven by [coalitional instincts](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coalitional-instincts).
