# More Dakka
More Dakka is the technique of throwing more resources at a problem to see if you get better results. 

Originally, More Dakka is the [trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka) of solving problems by unloading as many rounds of ammunition at them as possible. In the rationalist community it was popularized by [Zvi ](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/z8usYeKX7dtTWsEnk/more-dakka)to have the above meaning.
