The rationalist movement, rationality community,[1](#fn1) rationalsphere or rationalistsphere[2](#fn2) represents a set of modes of [bayesian](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism) thinking from self-described [rationalists](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/rationalist) or '[aspiring rationalists](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/aspiring-rationalist)' typically associated with the [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) [diaspora](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/diaspora) and their associated communities.

## History
Following the wind-down of the first era of [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) in 2014, triggered primarily via the departure of [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/eliezer-yudkowsky) and other top writers, the formerly closer-knit on and offline groups continue with a lessened central focus.

Arguably, [Scott Alexander](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/scott-alexander) has emerged as the most influential remaining figurehead and [Slate Star Codex](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/slate-star-codex) commands the highest single point of engagement within the restructured community.

In 2016-2017, discussion of revival occurred and Vaniver was made benevolent dictator for life. He in turn empowered Oliver Habryka to form a team and launch the LessWrong 2.0 project which runs the current site.

## Illustration
A popular illustration of the communities comprising and related to the movement was created in 2014 on [Slate Star Codex](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/slate-star-codex)[3](#fn3)[4](#fn4) (above).

A 2017 conceptual Venn diagram of the 'rationalsphere' has also been created.[5](#fn5)

## Definitions
[Scott Alexander](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/scott-alexander) has also suggested the following definition in 2016:[6](#fn6)

> The rationalist community is a group of people (of which I’m a part) who met reading the site [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/about) and who tend to [hang out together online](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/diaspora), [sometimes hang out together in real life](https://www.lesswrong.com/about_meetup_groups), and tend to befriend each other, work with each other, date each other, and generally move in the same social circles. Some people[7](#fn7) call it a cult, but that’s more a sign of some people having lost vocabulary for anything between “totally atomized individuals” and “outright cult” than any [particular cultishness](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/phyg).But people keep asking me what exactly the rationalist community is. Like, what is the thing they believe that makes them rationalists? It can’t just be about being [rational](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalism), because loads of people are interested in that and most of them aren’t part of the community. And it can’t just be about [transhumanism](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/transhumanism) because there are a lot of transhumanists who aren’t rationalists, and lots of rationalists who aren’t transhumanists. And it can’t just be about [Bayesianism](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism), because pretty much everyone, rationalist or otherwise, agrees that is a kind of statistics that is useful for some things but not others. So what, exactly, is it?This question has always bothered me, but now after thinking about it a lot I finally have a clear answer: rationalism is the belief that [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/eliezer-yudkowsky) is the rightful caliph.No! Sorry! I think “the rationalist community” is a tribe much like the Sunni or Shia that started off with some pre-existing differences, found a rallying flag, and then developed a culture.

Other definitions include:[8](#fn8)

> ...typical rationalist philosophical positions include reductionism, materialism, moral non-realism, utilitarianism, anti-[deathism](https://hpluspedia.org/wiki/Deathism) and transhumanism. Rationalists across all three groups tend to have high opinions of the [Sequences](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/sequences) and Slate Star Codex and cite both in arguments; rationalist discourse norms were shaped by [How To Actually Change Your Mind](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/how-to-actually-change-your-mind) and [37 Ways Words Can Be Wrong](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human's_Guide_to_Words), among others.

And:[9](#fn9)

> ...a community that call themselves Rationalists, that read ‘high-IQ sites’ such as [Marginal Revolution](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Marginal_Revolution), Less Wrong, and Slate Star Codex, and according to various surveys, identify as liberal, are atheist or agnostic, and, in general, hold a ‘realist’ philosophical worldview.

## 
 

[Raemon](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Raemon) argues the rationalist movement could be subdivided into individualistic and organisational views.[11](#fn11) [Project Hufflepuff](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Project_Hufflepuff) attempts to strengthen both approaches.

The Rationalsphere

Contains key modes of thinking for the individual including:

- Truthseeking - biases, empiricism etc
- Impact - making the world a better place ( e.g. effective altruism, AI safety )
- Human - becoming a better person

On the other hand:

The Rationality Community

Encompasses the major subscribing organisations ( [CFAR](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/CFAR), [Giving What We Can](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Giving_What_We_Can) etc ) as well as the many [meetup groups](https://www.lesswrong.com/about_meetup_groups) , friends and relationships discovered from participation in the community.

## Skepticism of term
There is a some drive to avoid any 'isms' and instead focus on 'rationality' rather than 'rationalism.[23](#fn23)

## Culture
The culture is often defined by its saying such as those featured in [rationalists-out-of-context.tumblr.com](https://rationalists-out-of-context.tumblr.com).
