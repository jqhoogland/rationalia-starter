# Complexity of Value
Complexity of value is the thesis that human values have high [Kolmogorov complexity](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity); that our [preferences](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/preferences), the things we care about, cannot be summed by a few simple rules, or compressed. [Fragility of value](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/) is the thesis that losing even a small part of the rules that make up our values could lead to results that most of us would now consider as unacceptable (just like dialing nine out of ten phone digits correctly does not connect you to a person 90% similar to your friend). For example, all of our values except novelty might yield a future full of individuals replaying only one optimal experience through all eternity.

Many human choices can be compressed, by representing them by simple rules - the desire to survive produces innumerable actions and subgoals as we fulfill that desire. But people don't just want to survive - although you can compress many human activities to that desire, you cannot compress all of human existence into it. The human equivalents of a utility function, our terminal values, contain many different elements that are not strictly reducible to one another. William Frankena offered [this list](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-intrinsic-extrinsic/#WhaHasIntVal) of things which many cultures and people seem to value (for their own sake rather than strictly for their external consequences):...[(Read More)]()
