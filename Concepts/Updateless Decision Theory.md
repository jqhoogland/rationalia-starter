## Motivation
Updateless Decision Theory (UDT) is a decision theory meant to deal with a fundamental problem in the existing decision theories: the need to treat the agent as a part of the world in which it makes its decisions. In contrast, in the most common decision theory today, [[Causal Decision Theory]] (CDT), the deciding agent is not part of the world model--its decision is the output of the CDT, but the agent's decision in the world context is "magic": in the moment of deciding, no causal links feed into its chosen action. It acts as though its decision was causeless, as in some dualist free-will theories.

Getting this issue right is critical in building a self-improving artificial general intelligence, as such an AI must analyze its own behavior and that of a next generation that it may build.

Updateless Decision Theory was invented by [Wei Dai](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/wei_dai) and first described in [Towards a New Decision Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/de3xjFaACCAk6imzv/towards-a-new-decision-theory)....[(Read More)]()
