Let's look at supposed scientific mavericks ignored by the mainstream.

- Svante Arrhenius
	- > His idea that electrolytes are full of charged atoms was considered crazy. The atomic theory was new at the time, and everyone “knew” that atoms were indivisible (and hence they could not lose or gain any electric charge.) Because of his heretical idea, he only received his university degree by a very narrow margin.
	- Yes, but apart from his PhD judges, chemists were super excited to
	- work with him.
- Hans Alfven
	- > Astronomers thought that gravity alone is important in solar systems, in galaxies, etc. Alfven’s idea that plasma physics is of equal or greater importance to gravity was derided for decades.
- John Baird
	- > When the first television system was demonstrated to the Royal Society (British scientists,) they scoffed and ridiculed, calling Baird a swindler.
	- "They didn't believe it" in the colloquial sense of "thought it was amazing"
- Robert Bakker
	- Cold-blooded -> warm-blooded dinosaurs
	- He was not on his own
- Baradeen & Brattain
	- Their boss nixed their idea for non-FET "crystal triode" device.
	- This example is wrong somehow.
- Bretz
	- > His crime was to insist that enormous amounts of evidence showed that, in Eastern Washington state, the “scabland” desert landscape had endured an ancient catastrophy: a flood of staggering proportions. This was outright heresy, since the geology community of the time had dogmatic belief in a “uniformitarian” position, where all changes must take place slowly and incrementally over vast time scales.
- Chandrasekhar
	- Attacked by Eddington but supported by many others
- Chladni
	- > The scientific community regarded Meteorites in the same way that modern scientists regard UFO abductions and psychic phenomenon: quaint superstitions only believed by peasant folk.
- Crick and Watson
	- > Not ridiculed. But they were instructed to drop their research. They continued it as “bootleg” research.
- Doppler
	- His effect seems to actually not have been particularly debated.

Examples of modern science that weren't as bad as Alexander originally thought.

- The Replication crisis
- Nutrition
- Social-Justice-Related Issues
- Nurture Assumption & Blank Slatism
- Intelligence Explosion & AI Risk
- IQ

> Again and again I have *tried* to defy scientific consensus. And every time, I either find that I am wrong, find that I am a few years ahead of a trend that most scientists eventually agree with, or find that what I thought was “scientific consensus” was actually a fiction peddled by biased industry or media sources slandering a scientific community which actually had a much more sophisticated picture.

> So maybe the things I’m saying about scientific consensus aren’t very actionable. But respecting scientific consensus in a non-actionable way is a lot less exhausting than believing yourself to be against it, and talking about how you’re against it, and taking flak for being against it
