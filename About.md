# Rationalia

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to your personal guide to [[LessWrong]], [[The Effective Altruism Forum]], and [[The AI Alignment Forum]]

This repository is a starting point to take notes on the concepts, terms, jargon, and principles you'll find in [[LessWrong]], [[The Effective Altruism Forum]]. It was built with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) in mind (as a starter template for a new vault or for your existing vault).

## Motivation

LessWrong and its compatriots have accumulated a lot of posts over the years. This can be daunting for newcomers. Sure you can grind through [[Rationality A-Z|The Sequences]], but it's going to take a lot more work to actually keep the information in long-term memory.

In particular, the aim of this repository is:

- To get you up to speed with [[Concepts (LW)|LessWrong's "concepts"]] and [[Jargon]] and with [[Topics (EA)|EA's "topics"]].[^0]
- To walk you through [[Library (LW)|LessWrong's]], [[The AI Alignment Forum|AF]] and [[Library (EA)|EA's]] "standard" libraries.

## Structure

This vault consists of note-taking templates[^1] that correspond to published posts. These templates are usually pretty bare (you're the one taking the notes).

What you can expect to find is:

- **Metadata** (tags, external links, authors, etc.)
- Internal (bidirectional) **links**
- A **definition**(s) and flashcard template(s) (occasionally)

## How to Start

- [[LessWrong]]
- [[The Effective Altruism Forum]]
- [[The AI Alignment Forum]]

[^0]: Each concept note has one or more flashcard templates that you can use to [autogenerate Anki flashcards](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki). We recommend [rewording the provided definition into your own words](https://www.supermemo.com/#Personalize%20and%20provide%20examples).
