There are no rules requiring minds to value life, liberty or the pursuit of happiness. An alien will have, in all probability, alien values. If an "alien" isn't evolved, the [range of possible values](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mind-design-space) increases even more, allowing such [absurdities](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/absurdity-heuristic) as a [Paperclip maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/paperclip-maximizer). Creatures with alien values might as well value *only* non-sentient life, or they might spend all their time building [heaps of prime numbers of rocks](http://lesswrong.com/lw/sy/sorting_pebbles_into_correct_heaps/).
