The VNM theorem is one of the classic results of Bayesian decision theory. It establishes that, under four assumptions known as the VNM axioms, a preference relation *must* be representable by maximum-expectation decision making over some real-valued utility function. (In other words, rational decision making is best-average-case decision making.)

Starting with some set of outcomes, gambles (or lotteries) are defined recursively. An outcome is a gamble, and for any finite set of gambles, a probability distribution over those gambles is a gamble.

Preferences are then expressed over gambles via a preference relation. if A is preferred to B, this is written A>B. We also have indifference, written A∼B. If A is either preferred to B *or* indifferent with B, this can be written A≥B....[(Read More)]()
