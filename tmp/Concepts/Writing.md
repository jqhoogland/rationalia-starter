# [[Purpose]]

- To force myself to publish regularly so I get the feedback and reward that makes me a better writer (and [[Zettelkasten]] user).
	- See [[Deliberate practice]], Shorten
- And because [[Writing is thinking]] and thinking is worth it
	- See [[Why write?]]

# A Note on Starting Small

- In past [[Zettelkasten]] attempts, I quickly wanted to begin writing books and entire series. But those aspirations killed any chance I ever had at actually writing those books.
- It stopped me from publishing, and that ended the habits before they could form. This time, I've forbidden myself from (intentionally) working towards the more ambitious book deals. Short-term focus until long-term consistency.
