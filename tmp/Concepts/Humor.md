# Humor

Humor. This tag is a joke.

Humorists are often the youngest:

- Kurt Kurt Vonnegut
- [[Elmer Hoogland]]

It's often a protective mechanism:

- Vonnegut against his German heritage post-WWII.
- [[Mark Twain]] against his participation on the side of the confederacy.

The brevity of humor:

> "The problem is that jokes deal so efficiently with ideas that there is little more to be said after the punch line."
