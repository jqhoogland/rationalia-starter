# Public Discourse
Public discourse refers to our ability to have conversations *in large groups*, both as a society, and in smaller communities; as well as conversations between a few well-defined participants (such as presidential debates) that take place publicly. 

This tag is for understanding the nature of public discourse (How good is it? What makes it succeed or fail?), and ways of improving it using technology or novel institutions.
