# General Intelligence
General Intelligence or Universal Intelligence is the ability to efficiently achieve goals in a wide range of domains.Â 

This tag is specifically for discussing intelligence in the broad sense: for discussion of IQ testing and psychometric intelligence, see [[ g-factor]]; for discussion about e.g. specific results in artificial intelligence, see [[AI]]. These tags may overlap with this one to the extent that they discuss the nature of general intelligence.
