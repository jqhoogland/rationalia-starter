# Ideological Turing Tests
The Ideological Turing Test is an exercise where you try to pretend to hold an opposing ideology convincingly enough that outside observers can't reliably distinguish you from a true believer.

[It was first described by economist Bryan Caplan:](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html)

Passing the ideological Turing test is a sign that you understand the opposing ideology on a deep level.
