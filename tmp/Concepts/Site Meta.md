# Site Meta
Site Meta is the category for discussion about LessWrong website. It includes technical updates. It applies to team announcements such as updates, features, events, moderation activity and policy, downtime, requests for feedback, as well as site documentation,  and the team’s writings about site philosophy/strategic thinking.

The tag also applies to any discussion of the site norms/moderation, feature requests, questions, and ideas about what the site should do – regardless of author.
