Debiasing is the process of overcoming [[Bias|bias]]. Results in being able to systematically avoid stupidity in certain situations where intuitive [[Heuristic|heuristics]] run amok. It takes serious study to gain meaningful benefits, half-hearted attempts may accomplish nothing, and partial knowledge of bias may do more [[Dangerous Knowledge|harm]] than good.

Simply being told about the biases rarely helps to notice and overcome them. For example, the overestimation of prior probability of an event that has already happened caused by [[1 Projects/Learning/Rationalism/Concepts/Hindsight Bias|hindsight bias]] doesn't go away when people are told about this bias and when they try to counteract its effects. Due to [[Overconfidence|overconfidence]], often more than 50% of people report that they are capable of above-average performance. When asked about how good they are at overcoming overconfidence, they exhibit the same bias[1](#fn1).
