Science is a method for developing true beliefs about the world. It works by developing hypotheses about the world, creating experiments that would allow the hypotheses to be tested, and running the experiments. By having people publish their falsifiable predictions and their experimental results, science protects itself from individuals deceiving themselves or others.

# What is Science

Science is the application of the [[Scientific method]]

- > "Science is . . . reasoning about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the contents of the world" — [Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/5g5TkQTe9rmPS5vvM/p/46qnWRSR7L2eyNbMA))

Science (along with Liberalism) is *not* a metanarrative but a system "because they are *self-skeptical* rather than *self-certain*, by design" [@pluckrose2020]

# Why Science?

## [[Richard Feynman]]

1. Scientific knowledge empowers us to do and make. This requires an additional moral compass to steer.
	- Possibly still the path towards accomplishing a better future?
2. The satisfaction of [[Curiosity]] and thought. [[Wisdom]] ^e86241
	- And a Sense of wonder, awe, [[Mystery]] ^3ff467
	- "The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man"
	- With more knowledge comes a deeper, more wonderful mystery, luring one on to penetrate deeper still.
	- Religious experience: Our artists are unable to capture this.
	- "To note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or dance, that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for the atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms"
3. Practice with [[Uncertainty]], Ignorance => [[Rationality]]
	- "Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science"

## [[Albert Einstein]]

> "The scientist's religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is utterly insignificant reflection. This feeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds in keeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. It is beyond question closely akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages."

# Teaching Science

 - > "It is our responsibility as scientists . . . to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations." — [[Richard Feynman]]

We start by teaching the easier-to-use approximations, then move on to the more correct, harder-to-explain laws.

## And [[Art]]

Many people are slightly afraid of science. Many disparage the scientist as cold, not just materially-reductionist but aesthetically-reducing. I imagine the intersection between the two is rather large.

> "There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts" — [[Richard Feynman]]

## Scientific Accidents

From autobiographies of [[Richard Feynman]]:

- [[Millikan's oil drop experiment#^1bbf6f]]
	- Neutron-proton coupling being T was based on poor extrapolation. "Since then I never pay any attention to anything by 'experts'. I calculate everything myself."
- "This long history of learning how to not fool ourselves— of having utter scientific integrity—is, I'm sorry to say, something that we haven't specifically included in any particular course that I know of."
- At a conference in Poland: The work is either not understandable, vague, self-evident but over-complicated, obviously counter to a well-established truth, or just wrong.
- Blondel's N-rays
