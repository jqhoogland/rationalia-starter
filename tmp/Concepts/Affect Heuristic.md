> The affect heuristic is a principle for making fast, perceptual judgments based on subjective impressions of goodness/badness. It can cause people to use one positive (or negative) fact about an object/action to judge the likely positivity or negativity of other facts about that object/action.

In other words: we tend to judge technologies by an overall good or bad feeling.

E.g.: Nuclear power
