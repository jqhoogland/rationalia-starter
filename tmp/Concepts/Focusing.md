# Focusing

Focusing refers to a family of introspective techniques taught by [[Center for Applied Rationality|CFAR]] whose aim is to access one's "gut" or "[[System 1]]" feelings. Archetypically, sensations within the body are approached with a spirit of gentle curiosity, and possible verbal labels are checked against felt senses. Where successful, this can improve internal understanding and allow split off trauma or conflict between [[Subagents]] to be processed for improved [[Internal Alignment (Human)|internal alignment]].

Focusing draws in name from the [book and technique](https://www.amazon.com/Focusing-Eugene-T-Gendlin/dp/0553278339) of the same name by psychologist Eugene Gendlin (Who's also known on LessWrong for the [[Litany of Gendlin]]), and since his introduction, some have developed their own variations \[[1](https://www.lessestwrong.com/posts/PXqQhYEdbdAYCp88m/focusing-for-skeptics)\].
