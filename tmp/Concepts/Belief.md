Belief is the mental state in which an individual holds a proposition to be true. Beliefs are often metaphorically referred to as maps, and are considered valid to the extent that they correctly correspond to the [[Truth, Semantics, & Meaning|truth]]. A person's knowledge is a subset of their beliefs, namely the beliefs that are also true and justified. Beliefs can be second-order, concerning propositions about other beliefs.

"The same brain that builds a network of inferred causes behind sensory experience can also build a network of causes that is not connected to sensory experience"

#### Types of belief:
- "Proper": Anticipation-controller
- "Improper":
	- Belief in belief
	- Professing
	- Cheering
	- Attire / Signaling group identity
	- Display of neutrality or suspended judgment

>  "If there were a verb meaning 'to believe falsely', it would not have any  
 significant first person, present indicative."  
 â€” Ludwig Wittgenstein

#### Examples of "false" belief:
- [[Wrong science]]
- Abstract humanities theories removed from reality

#### Belief as anticipation
- [[Empiricism]]: Focus on anticipation, not belief 

In arguments: always keep in mind the difference of anticipations, otherwise you may be debating labels or floating beliefs.

Yudkowsky's [parable](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/7gRSERQZbqTuLX5re/p/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF) of Blue and Green Undergrounders. The social psychologist's version of [[The Republic#The parable of the cave]]
- One of the explanations for why settled but disputed issues persist is that people who learn the answer leave the conversation for greener pastures. 

#### [[Belief In Belief]]
Sagan's parable of the invisible dragon.
- [[Faith]] Dennett's **belief in belief**: that it's somehow proper & good to believe what you're "meant" to believe. Simpler: it's virtuous just to *believe*.
- It's less dangerous when someone has both belief in belief & belief. They'll put their [[Skin in the game]] for experimental predictions.

The [[Big Lie]] that [[Religion]] cannot be proven or disproven:
- First scientific experiment is the story of [[Old Testament#Elijah and the priests of Baal]]
- People used to actually believe. Only recently have they run back to belief because belief ("retreat to commitment"). 
- The [[New Testament]] has smaller miracles because the Romans had libraries.
- People think that ethics is all that's left of religion. They're as wrong as they could be about religion proving the Earth flat.
- The [[Old Testament]] never explicitly talks about a sense of [[Mystery]] at the complexity of the universe.

#### Religious professing
Dennett's **religious profession**: they're just saying it aloud.

#### Cheering
Yudkowsky's example of the pagan flaunting her pride at her self-evidently ridiculous "beliefs."

#### Attire / Signaling group identity
What if it's not about actually believing, it's just a case of [[Signaling]]: "cheering" for your team.

#### Display of neutrality or suspended judgment
Related: [[34. Be royal in your own fashion - act like a king to be treated like one]]

Often used to [[Signaling|signal]] maturity, impartiality, or superiority. It's pretentious. Also misses it's own intention. Neutrality is a definite judgment.

E.g.: the religious who respond to children's questions with "I used to ask those questions, but I've grown out of it"

#### Applause lights
Words or phrases meant to immediately conjure approval, like "democracy"

How to identify? The reversal test. If the negation sounds abnormal, then the original is probably normal and conveys no new information.

#### Recognizing false belief.
[[Spinoza]] thought we first passively accept a proposition to comprehent it before actively disbelieving it. 
[[Descartes]] thought we first comprehended, then considered, then judged.

How to test? [[Cognitive load]] then measure false positive / false negative ratio.
