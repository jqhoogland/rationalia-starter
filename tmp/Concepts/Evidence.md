Evidence for a given theory is the observation of an event that is more likely to occur if the theory is true than if it is false. (The event would be evidence against the theory if it is less likely if the theory is true.)

The [[Likelihood Ratio|likelihood ratio]] term P(B|A)P(B|¬A) from [[Bayes Theorem|Bayes' theorem]] is greater than 1 if the event B is evidence of the theory A, and less than 1 if the event is evidence against the theory.

Evidence is an event "entangled" (not quantum-mechanically) with what you want to know about. It has to have Mutual information with the target event.

Because we are part of the world, rational thought produces beliefs which can constitute evidence.

Beliefs *should* be contagious among honest folk because they should be correlated with reality.

A few types:

- **Legal evidence**: Rational evidence + additional standards
- **Scientific evidence**: Publicly reproducible (through [[Empiricism|experiment]]) knowledge.

Where to start? [[Occam's razor]]
