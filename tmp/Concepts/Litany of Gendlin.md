> The Litany of Gendlin:*What is true is already so.**Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.**Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.**And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.**Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.**People can stand what is true,**for they are already enduring it.*

> â€”[Eugene Gendlin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Gendlin)
