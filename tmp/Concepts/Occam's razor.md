> "Entities should not be multiplied without necessity"
> *"Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem"*

After Friar William of Ockham (c. 1287 - 1347)

In other words:

- The simplest explanation is usually the right one.
- More complex explanations require more evidence.

Formally: [[Solomonoff's universal prior]]

A corollary is that even simple explanations known to be "wrong" can be useful: [[The Map Is Not The Territory#All models are wrong]].

# Occam's Razor

Occam's razor (more formally referred to as the principle of parsimony) is a principle commonly stated as "Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity". When several theories are able to explain the same observations, Occam's razor suggests the simpler one is preferable. It must be noted that Occam's razor is a requirement for the simplicity of *theories*, not for the size of the systems described by those theories. For example, the immensity of the Universe isn't at odds with the principle of Occam's razor.

Occam's razor is necessitated by the conjunction rule of probability theory: the conjunction A and B is necessarily less (or equally, in the case of logical equivalence) probable than the A alone; [[Burdensome Details|every detail you tack onto your story drives the probability down]].

Occam's razor has been formalized as Minimum Description Length or Minimum Message Length, in which the total size of the theory is the length of the message required to describe the theory, plus the length of the message required to describe the evidence *using* the theory.[[Solomonoff Induction|Solomonoff induction]] is the ultimate case of [minimum message length](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/minimum_message_length) in which the code for messages can describe all computable hypotheses. This has jokingly been referred to as "[Solomonoff's lightsaber](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/solomonoff-induction)"â€¦.[(Read More)]()
