# Intellectual Progress
Intellectual Progress is the progressive accumulation of knowledge. Questions include *How is intellectual progress made? *and *How do we make more?* [Intellectual Progress (Individual-Level)](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/intellectual-progress-individual-level) and the [[Scholarship & Learning]] tag is focused on the learning and research of individuals. In contrast, Intellectual Progress (Society-Level) is about how we, humanity, collectively make progress on important questions. What broader conditions, institutions, and technologies enable progress?
