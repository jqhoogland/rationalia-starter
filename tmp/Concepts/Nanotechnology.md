# Nanotechnology
Nanotechnology is the field of study concerned with the manipulation of matter at an atomic and molecular scale. Tipically, this involves structures with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 nanometres. It is currently one of the most well-funded areas worlwide. The term was first coined in 1974 by Norio Taniguchi.

The emergence of nanotechnology as a field by itself was the result of the convergence of several lines of work. These include the development of the [scanning tunneling microscope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunneling_microscope) by Gerd Binnigg and Einrich Rohrer in 1980s, Richard Feynman's talk "There's plenty of room at the Bottom" in 1959 and Eric Drexler suggestions of molecular manipulation in the 70s.

The field of nanotechonology has led to the development of a huge amount of new technologies and the improvement of old methods. From drug-delivering systems to electronic chips development, there are nowadays hundreds of avaliable of functional applications stemming from this area. Besides the size and mobility advantages of such devices and technologies, the fundamental quantum properties that emerge at nano scales continue to defy researchers to speculate of further developments....[(Read More)]()
