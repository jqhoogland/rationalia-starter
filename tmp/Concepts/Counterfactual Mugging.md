Depending on how the problem in phrased, intuition calls for different answers. For example, [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has argued that framing the problem in a way Omega is a regular aspect of the environment which regularly asks such types of questions makes most people answer 'Yes'. However, Vladimir Nesov points out that [Rationalists Should Win](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARtkT3EYox3THYjF/rationality-is-systematized-winning) could be interpreted as suggesting that we should not pay. After all, even though paying in the tails case would cause you to do worse in the counterfactual where the coin came up heads, you already know the counterfactual didn't happen, so it's not obvious that you should pay. This issue has been discussed in [this question](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h9qQQA3g8dwq6RRTo/counterfactual-mugging-why-should-you-pay#h9Lc5j42HPao4aaep)....[(Read More)]()
