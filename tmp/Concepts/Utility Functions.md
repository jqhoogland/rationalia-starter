Human drives are not coherent nor is there any reason to think they would be ([Thou Art Godshatter](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/l3/thou_art_godshatter/)), and even people with a strong interest in the concept have trouble working out what their utility function actually is even slightly ([Post Your Utility Function](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/zv/post_your_utility_function/)). Furthermore, humans appear to calculate utility and disutility separately - adding one to the other does not predict their behavior accurately. This makes humans highly exploitable….[(Read More)]()
