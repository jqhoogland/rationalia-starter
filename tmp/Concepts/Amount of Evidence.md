To a Bayesian, evidence is a quantitative concept. In principle, a hypothetical Bayesian superintelligence could say not only *that* the evidence supports a particular hypothesis, but by *how much*. (In practice the true math is usually intractable.) The more complicated or *a priori* improbable a hypothesis is, the more evidence you need just to justify it, or even just [single it out](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/locate-the-hypothesis) of the amongst the mass of competing theories.

We often find it convenient to express the amount of evidence in terms of logarithms of odds, *decibels* if we use the base-10 logarithm, *bits* if we use the base-2.
