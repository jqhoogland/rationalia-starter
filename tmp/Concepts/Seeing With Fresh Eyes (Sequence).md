A [sequence](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/sequence) on the incredibly difficult feat of getting your brain to actually think about something, instead of instantly stopping on the first thought that comes to mind, that is Seeing with Fresh Eyes.

This is sometimes referred to as "thinking outside the box" by people who, for your convenience, will go on to helpfully point out exactly where "outside the box" is located. The Less Wrong version is called "thinking outside the 'Outside the Box' box". Isn't it funny how nonconformists all dress the same...

Subsequence of [[How To Actually Change Your Mind]].
