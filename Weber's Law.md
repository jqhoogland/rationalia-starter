Perceived intensity goes with log of intensity.

# Weber's Law

> "the minimum increase of stimulus which will produce a perceptible increase of sensation is [proportional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportionality_(mathematics) "Proportionality (mathematics)") to the pre-existent stimulus,

# Fechner's Law

> the intensity of our sensation increases as the [logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm "Logarithm") of an increase in energy rather than as rapidly as the increase
