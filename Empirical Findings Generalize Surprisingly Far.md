Despite [[More is Different for AI|emergence in ML systems]], empirical findings generalize surprisingly far, even across discrete transitions in abilities.

Examples:
- **Adversarial examples**: pretraining, few-shot learning, small architecture changes haven't changed the presence of and intervention for these examples
- **Data efficiency** & scaling laws
- **Out-of-distribution generalization**. So far, we haven't seen particularly crazy changes

Examples from biology:
- **The phage group** studied simpler phages to discover: DNA as the vehicle of genetic information, genetic recombination, linear gene arrangement, restriction enzymes, etc.
